<blockquote>
<p>dbt is the best way to manage a collection of data transformations
written in SQL or Python for analytics and data science. a required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DBT (Data Build Tool) is an open-source command-line tool that allows
data analysts and engineers to transform and manipulate data in their
data warehouse. It provides a framework for creating and executing
complex SQL queries and transforms, and it helps manage the entire data
transformation process.</p>
<p>DBT is designed to work with a variety of data warehouses, including
Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and others. It allows users to define
data models and transformations in a modular way, and it supports
version control and collaboration through Git.</p>
<p>With DBT, analysts can define reusable SQL code and maintain a
consistent data model across their organization. They can also build
automated testing and validation into their data pipelines, ensuring
data accuracy and consistency. Overall, DBT helps organizations build
data pipelines that are maintainable, scalable, and easy to
understand.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-dbt-do">What Does DBT Do?</h2>
<p>Can dbt be used to load data? No, dbt does not extract or load
data.</p>
<p>It focuses on the transformation step only.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dbt is a workflow orchestrator for SQL. In other words, it’s a fancy
Make for data analytics. What makes dbt special is that it is the first
workflow orchestrator that is dedicated to the SQL language. It said out
loud what many data teams were thinking: you can get a lot done with
SQL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>dbt encourages you to massage your data in SQL rather than in, say,
Python.</p>
<p>Tristian Hardy Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My primary MO as a data product thinker is stealing best practices
from the world of software engineering and porting them to the world of
data”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dbt brings the software engineering world to the SQL-savvy ELT
developer. It treats SQL queries as models — aka a SELECT script within
a package. All models — in dbt— represent tables and views within the
data warehouse. These models can be versioned, and their schema and data
can be tested — much as one would write unit tests for a piece of
software code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="dbt-core-concepts">DBT Core Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expressing transforms with SQL select</li>
<li>Automatically build the DAG with ref(s)</li>
<li>Tests ensure model accuracy</li>
<li>Documentation is accessible and easily updated</li>
<li>Use macros to write reusable SQL</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-is-dbt-popular">Why is DBT Popular?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“standardizing their SQL transformation layers on dbt as they moved
their data warehousing to the cloud.” dbt is the framework for modern
cloud data warehouse development. It lets you build out a new kind of
data pipeline that was never practical before. All while embracing
today’s best data practices: encapsulate business logic, check it into
git, test your data, connect it in a DAG But dbt exists today for a
reason. Cloud data warehouses demanded a new way of working. dbt met
that need by doing all-in on SQL. The result is pretty cool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These talks reflect the implicit ethos behind Snowflake and dbt: Our
problems aren’t new, we don’t want to reimagine, reinvent, or
revolutionize how we work to solve them, and we don’t want to be hit in
the face with new innovations. We just want the same tools we’ve always
had—a database and some SQL—with some modern new magic quietly tucked
behind them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-would-i-use-dbt">Why Would I Use DBT?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A small company can’t afford those tools (e.g., Informatica, SQL
Server Integration Services) – And they dont want to use
Microsoft</p></li>
<li><p>Want to allow analysts who know only SQL to build transform
pipelines – analysts can build their own data pipelines, allowing them
to work like software engineers</p></li>
<li><p>Want version control, unit testing, environment handling</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t want to use more expensive tools, or GUI tools</p></li>
<li><p>can use SQL to scale out complex data modeling operations on
modern cloud parallel SQL engines</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="role-in-analytics">Role in Analytics</h2>
<ul>
<li>why would we use dbt?</li>
</ul>
<p>DBT plays a critical role in an enterprise analytics pipeline by
providing a scalable and maintainable way to transform and manipulate
data in a data warehouse. Here are some specific ways that DBT can
support an analytics pipeline:</p>
<p>Transforming and modeling data: DBT allows data analysts and
engineers to define data models and transformations in a modular way
using SQL, making it easy to build complex data pipelines. DBT also
supports incremental loads, allowing analysts to quickly update their
data without having to reprocess the entire dataset.</p>
<p>Data validation and testing: DBT has built-in support for automated
testing and validation, allowing analysts to ensure data accuracy and
consistency. DBT can automatically run tests on data models and
transformations as part of a continuous integration and deployment
(CI/CD) pipeline.</p>
<p>Collaboration and version control: DBT integrates with Git, allowing
analysts to collaborate on data models and transformations using a
familiar version control system. This makes it easy to track changes to
data pipelines over time and maintain a consistent codebase.</p>
<p>Documentation and lineage tracking: DBT includes built-in
documentation features that allow analysts to document data models,
transformations, and pipelines, making it easier for other team members
to understand the data and how it’s transformed. DBT also supports
lineage tracking, allowing analysts to track data from its source to its
destination and ensure data quality.</p>
<p>Overall, DBT provides a scalable and maintainable way to transform
and manipulate data in a data warehouse, making it an essential tool for
enterprise analytics pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-dbt-replace">what does DBT replace?</h3>
<p>DBT is not designed to replace any specific tool or technology, but
rather to complement and enhance existing data warehousing and analytics
tools. DBT can be used alongside ETL tools, such as Apache Airflow or
Apache Nifi, and data visualization tools, such as Tableau or Looker, to
provide a more complete data analytics solution.</p>
<p>However, DBT does offer some unique features that can replace certain
manual or ad-hoc data transformation processes. For example, DBT can
replace custom SQL scripts that are used to transform data, as it
provides a more modular and reusable way to define data transformations.
DBT also provides a more scalable way to transform data compared to
traditional ETL tools, which may require significant maintenance and
updates as the data pipeline grows in complexity.</p>
<p>Overall, DBT is a powerful tool that can enhance and streamline
existing data analytics pipelines, but it’s not designed to replace any
specific tool or technology outright.</p>
<h3
id="we-want-to-transform-the-raw-data-into-a-shape-thats-ready-for-analytics">We
want to transform the raw data into a shape that’s ready for
analytics</h3>
<p>The solution: transform the raw data into a shape that’s ready for
analytics. At the time, there were only two widely-used options: 1.
Looker’s Persistent Derived Tables 2. Get a data engineer involved</p>
<p>However: DBT may replace a system that has a lot of transforms in
Looker (As PDTs)</p>
<h1 id="how-do-you-get-started-with-dbt">How Do You Get Started with
DBT?</h1>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-dbt-project">Anatomy of a DBT Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>core files</li>
<li>directory structure</li>
<li>configuring a dbt project</li>
<li>connecting to databases</li>
</ul>
<p>A DBT project is typically organized into several folders and files,
each with a specific purpose. Here is a breakdown of the typical
structure of a DBT project:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Models: This folder contains the SQL code that defines data
models and transformations. Each model is typically defined in a
separate SQL file.</p></li>
<li><p>Data: This folder contains any data files or SQL scripts needed
to support data modeling and transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>Macros: This folder contains reusable SQL code that can be called
from data models or transformations.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis: This folder contains SQL scripts that perform data
analysis or generate reports.</p></li>
<li><p>Tests: This folder contains SQL scripts that test the validity of
data models or transformations.</p></li>
<li><p>dbt_project.yml: This file defines the configuration settings for
the DBT project, such as the target database and credentials, and other
project-specific settings.</p></li>
<li><p>profiles.yml: This file contains the database connection
information, such as the host, username, password, and database
name.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation: This folder contains documentation generated by
DBT about the data models, tests, and macros defined in the
project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By organizing a DBT project in this way, it becomes easier to manage
and maintain data pipelines, collaborate with other team members, and
implement automated testing and validation.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts-in-dbt-data-modeling">Core Concepts in DBT Data
Modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Model – what is it?</li>
<li>[ TODO: Diagram HERE ]</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a nice article:</p>
<p>https://www.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering/modular-data-modeling-technique/</p>
<p><img src="https://www.getdbt.com/ui/img/guides/analytics-engineering/intermediate_data_models.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
<p>A DBT data model is a SQL query that defines a specific view of data
in a data warehouse. The data model can include joins, filters,
aggregations, and other transformations that shape the data into a
format that’s easier to work with for downstream analysis and
reporting.</p>
<p>DBT models are defined using SQL syntax and can be composed of other
models or database tables. Models are defined in separate SQL files, and
DBT provides a mechanism for organizing models into a modular
structure.</p>
<p>DBT models are incremental, which means that DBT only processes the
new or changed data since the last time the model was run. This makes
DBT models more efficient than traditional ETL processes that require
processing all of the data each time.</p>
<p>DBT data models are part of a larger data pipeline that transforms
raw data into a format that’s more useful for data analysis and
reporting. By using DBT to define data models, analysts can build
complex data pipelines that are modular, maintainable, and easy to test
and validate.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In this blog post we gave you an overview of DBT and then showed how
to build a simple “Hello World”-style of application. For more
information on DBT, check out their documentation. For more information
on cloud infrastructure, check out the rest of the articles in our
blog.</p>
