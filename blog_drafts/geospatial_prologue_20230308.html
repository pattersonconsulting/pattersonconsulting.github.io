<p>The world is facing countless decision problems that often require balancing competing criteria: How to respond to new pandemic diseases while reducing their economic impact? How to react to a changing climate while sustaining economic growth? How to reduce community violence while preserving liberties? How to plan for city growth while considering effects to the environment and social inequality?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world is changing</p>
<pre><code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the value of all goods and services produced within a country&#39;s borders in a given period of time. GDP growth is important for a country&#39;s economic competitiveness in the world because it reflects the country&#39;s ability to increase its productive capacity and generate more income, which can be used to improve the standard of living for its citizens and invest in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other areas that contribute to economic growth.

There are several reasons why GDP growth is important for a country&#39;s competitiveness:

Trade: Countries with higher GDPs are generally more competitive in global trade because they have more resources and are better able to produce goods and services at a lower cost. This can lead to lower prices for consumers, higher profits for businesses, and greater economic growth.

Investment: Higher GDP growth rates can attract more foreign investment, as investors seek opportunities in countries with strong economic growth potential. This can help boost job creation and technology transfer, as well as contribute to the overall economic development of the country.

Innovation: Countries with higher GDP growth rates tend to invest more in research and development, which can lead to new technologies, products, and services. This can give them a competitive advantage in the global marketplace, as well as contribute to their overall economic growth.

International Reputation: Countries with strong economic growth rates tend to have a positive international reputation, which can lead to increased diplomatic and political influence. This can help them negotiate more favorable trade agreements, as well as contribute to their overall geopolitical power and influence.

In summary, GDP growth is important for a country&#39;s economic competitiveness because it reflects the country&#39;s ability to increase its productive capacity, generate more income, attract investment, stimulate innovation, and enhance its international reputation.</code></pre>
<p>How does manufacturing play a role in this?</p>
<p>How does the Red Queen drive productivity?</p>
<p>Climate change is here</p>
<pre><code>Climate change can have significant impacts on a country&#39;s GDP in several ways.

Natural Disasters: Climate change can increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure, property, and crops. This can lead to lower productivity and economic output, as well as higher costs for disaster response and recovery.

Agriculture: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can also affect agricultural productivity, leading to lower yields, reduced crop quality, and increased risk of pests and diseases. This can result in higher food prices, lower farm incomes, and reduced GDP growth.

Energy and Transport: Climate change can also affect the energy and transport sectors, which are key drivers of economic growth. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can impact energy demand and supply, as well as transportation infrastructure such as roads, airports, and ports. This can result in higher costs for energy and transport, as well as reduced economic activity.

Health: Climate change can also affect human health, which can have significant economic impacts. Higher temperatures can increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, while changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased incidence of waterborne diseases such as cholera. This can result in higher healthcare costs, lower productivity, and reduced economic growth.

Tourism: Climate change can also affect the tourism industry, which is an important source of revenue for many countries. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can impact tourist behavior, leading to reduced demand for certain destinations and activities. This can result in lower revenues for businesses and governments, as well as reduced GDP growth.

In summary, climate change can have significant impacts on a country&#39;s GDP through its effects on natural disasters, agriculture, energy and transport, health, and tourism. These impacts can lead to lower productivity, higher costs, reduced revenues, and lower economic growth.</code></pre>
<p>How we use our resources is more important than ever</p>
<p>Foundationally, managing cities are key to mitigating climate change</p>

<h2 id="key-challenges-faced-by-cities-today">Key Challenges Faced by Cities Today</h2>
<p>The core challenges faced by the managers and operators of urban centers today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population Growth</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Operational Costs</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Building Codes, Infrastructure, and Compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these challenges can be measured through data yet many today are not managed effectively. Population growth in urban centers is a key driver towards more managed solutions for other aspects of city management such as traffic.</p>
<pre><code>City managers of major urban centers face a wide range of challenges in their efforts to ensure that their cities are livable, sustainable, and prosperous. Some of the core challenges that they face include:

Infrastructure: Cities need modern and resilient infrastructure to function effectively and support economic growth. However, many urban centers are grappling with outdated infrastructure that is struggling to keep up with growing demand. This includes transportation systems, water and wastewater systems, and energy networks.

Housing: Rapid urbanization is putting a strain on housing in many cities, with skyrocketing housing costs and shortages of affordable housing. This can lead to social and economic inequality, as low-income residents are priced out of desirable neighborhoods.

Climate Change: Cities are on the front lines of climate change, facing the threat of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other environmental risks. City managers need to develop and implement effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to these risks, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green infrastructure.

Economic Development: Cities need to be able to attract investment, create jobs, and provide opportunities for their residents. This requires careful planning and investment in key sectors such as technology, healthcare, and education.

Public Safety: City managers need to ensure that their cities are safe and secure for residents, visitors, and businesses. This requires effective law enforcement, emergency preparedness, and community engagement.

Social Services: Cities have a responsibility to provide essential social services such as education, healthcare, and social welfare. However, funding constraints and growing demand can make it difficult for city managers to provide these services at the level required.

In summary, city managers of major urban centers face a wide range of challenges related to infrastructure, housing, climate change, economic development, public safety, and social services. Addressing these challenges requires careful planning, investment, and collaboration across different levels of government, as well as with private sector and community stakeholders.</code></pre>
<p>In the following sub-sections we take a look at published research on each of these challenges.</p>
<h3 id="population-growth">Population Growth</h3>
<p>Many research papers and studies show a strong trend of population movement into major cities as expressed in the passage below from the University of Michigan:</p>
<p>http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-cities-factsheet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Approximately 84% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, up from 64% in 1950. By 2050, 89% of the U.S. population and 68% of the world population is projected to live in urban areas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another publication states the following:</p>
<p>https://graylinegroup.com/urbanization-catalyst-overview/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Nations in 2009 and the International Organization for Migration in 2015 both estimated that around 3 million people are moving to cities every week. Approximately 54% of people worldwide now live in cities, up from 30% in 1950. Sources estimate this will grow to 2/3 of world population in the next 15-30 years. More than half of urban dwellers live in the 1,022 cities with greater than 500,000 inhabitants. There are currently 29 megacities with populations of over 10 million, up from 2 in 1950 and projected to grow to between 41 and 53 by 2030. Additionally, there are 468 cities with a population of over 1 million, up from 83 in 1950.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UN website goes on to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization, the gradual shift in residence of the human population from rural to urban areas, combined with the overall growth of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa, according to a new United Nations data set launched today.“”</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Population movement to major cities has undergone significant changes over the past 100 years. Here are some of the key trends:

Urbanization: The world&#39;s population has become increasingly urbanized over the past century. In 1950, around 30% of the world&#39;s population lived in urban areas, while in 2020, it was over 55%. This trend is projected to continue, with the UN estimating that over 68% of the world&#39;s population will live in urban areas by 2050.

Regional Shifts: There have been significant regional shifts in urbanization over the past century. In the early 1900s, Europe and North America were the most urbanized regions, but by the mid-20th century, Latin America and Asia had become more urbanized. Today, Africa has the highest rate of urbanization, with over 40% of its population living in cities.

Megacities: The number of megacities (cities with over 10 million people) has grown rapidly over the past century. In 1950, there were only two megacities (New York and Tokyo), while in 2020, there were over 30. This trend is projected to continue, with the UN estimating that there will be over 40 megacities by 2030.

Rural-Urban Migration: Rural-urban migration has been a major driver of urbanization over the past century. People have moved from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities, education, healthcare, and other services. However, this has also led to urbanization and increased pressure on urban infrastructure and services.

Suburbanization: In recent decades, there has been a trend towards suburbanization, with people moving to the outskirts of cities in search of lower housing costs and better quality of life. This has led to the growth of suburban areas and increased demand for transportation infrastructure.

In summary, population movement to major cities has undergone significant changes over the past century, with increasing urbanization, regional shifts, the growth of megacities, rural-urban migration, and suburbanization. These trends have significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure, and services, as well as for social and economic development.</code></pre>
<h4 id="growth-factors-of-cities">Growth Factors of cities</h4>
<p>Some of the drivers of the growth of city population size include: <a href="http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/essay/factors-influencing-growth-of-cities-around-the-world/24287">http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/essay/factors-influencing-growth-of-cities-around-the-world/24287</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Surplus Resources</li>
<li>Industrialization and Commercialization</li>
<li>Development of Transport and Communication</li>
<li>Economic Pull of the City</li>
<li>Educational and Recreational Facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1507006859818901506</p>
<pre><code>The growth of major cities is driven by a combination of factors, including:

Economic opportunities: Many people are attracted to cities because they offer greater economic opportunities than rural areas. Cities are often home to a wide range of industries and businesses, providing job opportunities across different sectors.

Infrastructure and services: Cities offer a wide range of infrastructure and services, including public transportation, healthcare, education, and cultural amenities. This makes them attractive to people who want access to these resources.

Social and cultural diversity: Cities are often more diverse than rural areas, with people from different backgrounds and cultures living and working together. This diversity can create a vibrant social and cultural scene, making cities attractive to people who value these experiences.

Technology and innovation: Many cities are hubs for technology and innovation, attracting people who are interested in working in these fields. Cities offer access to research institutions, startup incubators, and other resources that support innovation and entrepreneurship.

Political and social stability: Cities are often more politically and socially stable than rural areas, with well-established systems of governance and law enforcement. This can make them attractive to people who are seeking a sense of security and stability.

Climate and geography: The climate and geography of a city can also influence its growth. For example, cities located in coastal areas or near major rivers or ports may have better access to trade and commerce, while cities with mild climates may be more attractive to people seeking a comfortable living environment.

In summary, the growth of major cities is driven by a complex set of factors, including economic opportunities, infrastructure and services, social and cultural diversity, technology and innovation, political and social stability, and climate and geography. These factors combine to make cities attractive to a wide range of people, and they will likely continue to drive the growth of major cities in the future.</code></pre>
<h3 id="traffic">Traffic</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Two million more people: Provincial plans anticipate that the population of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will grow by approximately two million people over the next 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>New housing and infrastructure required: This will require the construction of new housing, institutional and commercial supports, transportation systems, and servicing infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pace of rapid urbanization: Rapid urbanization will present environmental, social and traffic congestion challenges, which can impose costs on residents and businesses alike.</p>

<p>Another report identifies: <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialplanningtoronto/pages/574/attachments/original/1487348389/Report-v4-web.pdf?1487348389">https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialplanningtoronto/pages/574/attachments/original/1487348389/Report-v4-web.pdf?1487348389</a></p>
<p>Major concerns around this growth are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Gentrification</li>
<li>Lack of affordable housing</li>
<li>Transit</li>
<li>Lack of amenities and greenspace</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operational-costs">Operational Costs</h3>
<p>Cities are progressively finding it harder to manage the higher operational burden with the same resources as before: “Recent <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money">research</a> into the tax efficiency (property tax revenues vs. infrastructure maintenance costs) of a variety of American cities and found that walkable urban districts tended to be revenue-positive – in effect, subsidizing surrounding low-density areas” <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money">https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money</a></p>
<h4 id="fiscal-issues-facing-the-operations-of-cities">Fiscal Issues Facing the Operations of Cities</h4>
<p>As cities become more complex, costs are outpacing tax revenue: “One evident problem is fiscal: Cities typically have serious difficulties in paying for basic services such as policing, public education, trash removal, street maintenance, and snow removal (at least in cold climates), and in providing certain services for their residents who are poor or disabled or who have other conditions. “</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>Planning is compelling to look at from a historical perspective. Appendix A of this report shows a table with the largest cities in history over the past 9,000 years. We can see a trend of cities hitting a progressively larger size plateau over time. In this sub-section on planning we take a look at some of the historical aspects of city infrastructure, building codes, and failures of major cities.</p>
<h4 id="historical-sanitation-and-issues-with-a-growing-city">Historical Sanitation and Issues with a Growing City</h4>
<p>For a many hundreds of years core sanitation practices limited the size of cities as plagues and disease continually restricted the growth of urban centers through killing off large portions of the population, as discussed in the following quote:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/plague-and-the-city/">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/plague-and-the-city/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When the Black Death, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, swept across Europe it killed over 1/3 of the population. This level of destruction is almost impossible to imagine today (particularly given that one third of the population of Europe today would be around 250 million people). One of the things that helped the bacteria to thrive was the conditions that the cities encouraged. Yersinia infects fleas, which travel on rats and huge populations of rats could be found in every major city in Europe. Often I suspect, they outnumbered the people. It wasn't just rats either, cities were crammed with animals including sheep, goats and pigs. Animals and humans in close proximity creates a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases, which can be highly deadly when they switch species.“</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not only are cities a good way to put humans and animals in close contact, they are also notorious for ill-health and bad living conditions compared to nomadic lifestyles. Water has to be brought in and shared around between many people. Overcrowding is common, as are disease vectors such as fleas and bed-bugs that can carry bacteria between humans. With the bad conditions, the close cramped living conditions and the complete lack of understanding of germ theory it's no wonder the disease swept through Europe until pretty much everyone had either died or survived.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Before the development of cities bacterial diseases would have been present (cystitis springs to mind…) but the virulent and decimating plague-bearing diseases were unlikely to have arisen, or if they did there was no way for them to spread so far. Hunter gatherer populations did face hardships but on general they ate better and more regularly, got more exercise, and drank water that they were pretty certain was not contaminated. Cities might provide protection, and a solid base for trade and economic infrastructure, but they are also a brilliant way to encourage bacteria to grow and spread disease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While cities were attracting people with protection and economic infrastructure, but city planning had not yet caught up to operating a city of that size. We can also see a list of the worst pandemics in history:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/">https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/</a></p>
<p>And then “How The Black Death moved around the world”: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The third great wave of plague began in China’s Yunnan province in 1894, emerged in Hong Kong and then spread via shipping routes throughout the world. It reached the United States through a plague ship from Hong Kong that docked at Hawaii, where plague broke out in December 1899, and then San Francisco, whose plague epidemic began in March 1900.” Beyond sanitation issues, there we also issues packing that many buildings closely together without consistent building rules.</p>

<h4 id="fires-that-changed-how-city-codes-were-written">Fires that Changed How City Codes were Written</h4>
<p>Many times in history natural urban sprawl set conditions such that entire cities burnt to the ground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_town_and_city_fires">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_town_and_city_fires</a></p>
<p>specifically in the united states in the past 100 years, specific fires have shaped how we write building codes: <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/~/media/Files/forms%20and%20premiums/101%20handbook/NFP101HB09_CHS1.pdf">https://www.nfpa.org/~/media/Files/forms%20and%20premiums/101%20handbook/NFP101HB09_CHS1.pdf</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fireprevention.utexas.edu/firesafety/historic-fires">https://fireprevention.utexas.edu/firesafety/historic-fires</a></p>
<p>To grow larger, cities had to change how they were built with better building codes and better operations.</p>
<h4 id="the-evolution-of-building-codes-and-compliance-to-allow-larger-cities">The Evolution of Building Codes and Compliance to Allow Larger Cities</h4>
<p>In response to such issues as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plagues</li>
<li>Fires</li>
<li>Earthquakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Cities began to change how they wrote their building codes and operated their cities. Development of basic potable water handling and sanitation codes helping clean up cities:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/5/17-1609_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/5/17-1609_article</a></p>
<p>A need for public health standards:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/medicine/disease/disease5.php">https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/medicine/disease/disease5.php</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Within three decades of establishment of the Board of Health, better regulation to ensure sanitary drinking water had begun to reduce instances of diseases such as hookworm, and more effective quarantining and more extensive state-run stations had allowed the state to limit the spread of yellow fever epidemics.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many cases, changing building codes proved to be a valuable endeavor:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/the-value-and-impact-of-building-codes">https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/the-value-and-impact-of-building-codes</a></p>
<p>In some cases, “some buildings are too expensive to change”, but cities were still able to raise the ceiling of maximum operating size with better codes and design. Urban planning and sanitation became key to building the major urban centers we see today.</p>
<h4 id="technology-as-a-mechanism-for-larger-cities-aqueducts">Technology as a Mechanism for Larger Cities: Aqueducts</h4>
<p>Lastly, we’ll note how infrastructure advancements (such as the Roman aqueducts) notably enabled certain cities to grow to previously unseen sizes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/roman-aqueducts/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/roman-aqueducts/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p> “The Romans could not have built cities as big as they did without aqueducts—and some of their cities wouldn't have existed at all. Romans sometimes built cities on dry plains. They'd find a spring in the mountains and take that water into the city, which would not have been possible without the transported water. With the water, they could have their baths, their fountains, and their drinking water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It also would be impossible to imagine Rome, which had about 1,000,000 people at its peak, without its large aqueducts. The Romans could have obtained their water from the river, wells, and springs, but these sources would have become polluted in a large city.”</p>

<li>Traffic management</li>
<li>City planning</li>
<li>City operations</li>
</ol>
<p>While initially Telus will focus on applications that service these utilities, eventually cities will want more applications that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Air</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Buildings</li>
<li>Optimize</li>
<li>Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>To help mitigate issues with code compliance, traffic congestion, operations optimization, and urban planning. As we’ve seen from the historical examples, new technology, codes, and infrastructure policies were needed to get cities to larger “plateaus” over the past 3000 years.</p>
<p>If we can do the above, we can operate efficiently enough to (hopefully) manage our infrastructure in such a manner we can support the new population levels for our region.</p>
<p>Now armed with better context around what are the growing “functional needs” in growth urban areas, we need to think about how to provide customer utility in the “right ways” at the right timing to grow into the ITS market. To better understand what to build to enter any new municipal segment, we take a look at the known success story of —- in the next section.</p>
