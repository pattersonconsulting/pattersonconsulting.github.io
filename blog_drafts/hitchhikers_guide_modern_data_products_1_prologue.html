<h2 id="how-to-read-the-series">How to Read The Series</h2>
<p>If you don’t care about the history and evolution stuff, maybe just
skip to part 3 <a
href="hitchhikers_guide_modern_data_products_3_lab_and_factory_redux.html">Revisting
The Lab and the Factory</a> – otherwise, this Prologue and then the
Evolution of Data Platforms should be fun background reading.</p>
<p>We spend the first 3 posts of this series providing background and
definitions to set the stage for our methodology and in part 4 we lay
out our step by step process.</p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-this-series">Purpose of This Series</h2>
<p>I wrote this series for 3 reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To better lay out my own thesis for building data products through
long-form writing</li>
<li>To give our customers a more complete guide on building data
products that can be shown in a 20-minute slide deck</li>
<li>To create a set of architectural guidelines for our team to use when
working through customer design decisions</li>
</ol>
<p>Building a market thesis is hard, and often, wrong. However,
long-form writing (10 pages+, in my definition) is a great way to
develop ideas, and is a necesary exercise for running a boutique
solution integration shop. This form of writing helps me create a rough
market hypothesis that helps guide our investments in the data product
space.</p>
<p>The notes in this series comes from working with customers over the
past 20 years in the data space, from working with Fortune 500 customers
while at Cloudera, to helping build the Deeplearning4j open source
library, to writing the Kubeflow Operations Guide, to working with our
Fortune 500 customers today at Patterson Consulting.</p>
<p>A key challenge for platform architects in the data industry is
understanding which tools to use and what the tradeoffs are if those
tools are used. There are so many vendors pushing their own “all-in-one”
platform magic solution that it can be dizzying to cut through the
noise.</p>
<p>An advantage that I have in writing a series such as this is that I
do not represent a software vendor and so I can play the (mostly)
neutral analyst.</p>
<p>Some of the content in this series is based on some of the
presentations we’ve given on the topic over the past 3 years (We also
offer consulting to venture capital groups and institutional investor
groups).</p>
<p>The most interesting underlying trends I highlight in this series
occur not on the quarterly scale, but “tectonic plate” movements across
the past decade.</p>
<p>My goal is to condense the vapor of nuance across the past decade of
data infrastructure into more solid concepts for building modern data
products. Given that most of us are just wandering along the vast data
super highways, I felt that the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” was a
good analogue for this series.</p>
<p>While there is a lot to consider and ruminate on in trying to
understand the data product/infrastructure space, the main thing to
remember is, as always:</p>
<p>Don’t Panic.</p>
<h2 id="the-tectonic-plates-of-the-data-industry">The Tectonic Plates of
the Data Industry</h2>
<p>In 2022 Covid had blown over enough that the conference circuit
started up again, and we headed out to a major cloud vendor
conference.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately struck me was how similar the conference
floor looked to that of O’Reilly Strata back in 2012. If you replaced
the cloud platform with Cloudera, the conference would look nearly
identical. Even some of the same ETL vendors still existed a decade
later (data ETL vendors? check. data load vendors? check. BI vendors
trying to disrupt Tableau? check.).</p>
<p>My immediate thought was that “nothing has changed”.</p>
<p>My next thought was “wait a minute, how can that possibly be?”</p>
<p>Some of the folks I saw there had the same reaction that I did. That
feeling of “Strata Deja Vu” stuck to me, and on the plane ride home I
started writing out notes on the market (which eventually became core
themes in this series) to better understand the evolutionary trajectory
from 2008 until 2022.</p>
<p>What bothered me was that “tectonic plates” (e.g., “fundamental
things”) in the industry had shifted, refactoring the data infratructure
space, but I was struggling to put my finger on exactly “what those
things were”.</p>
<p>In this series I’ll take a look at key ideas in the data space:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The original ideas around the “Lab and the Factory”</li>
<li>Key “tectonic plate” shifts of the past decade</li>
<li>The evolution of modern data pipelines</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking back at these ideas directly informs how I craft out
guidelines in part 4 of this series for building new data products. The
background and context of these topics directly inform the what and why
of making the design decisions needed to create new data products. To
get there, however, we need to be intentional about the terminology we
use and explicit in how these terms are defined.</p>
<h1
id="fuzzy-definitions-marketing-teams-and-the-need-to-be-specific">Fuzzy
Definitions, Marketing Teams, and the Need to Be Specific</h1>
<p>In this prologue, though, I want to establish some ground-truth
context around terminology — because in many conversations I’ve had on
this topic (accomplished, educated, experienced) folks make comments
such as</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m not really sure what data engineering is” (said by someone
‘known’ in the ML space)</li>
<li>“I couldn’t tell you where analytics starts and machine learning
begins”</li>
<li>“I’m not sure how long the term ‘feature engineering’ has been
around”</li>
</ul>
<p>When working on our internal notes on this topic for customers and
investors, I wasn’t entirely sure a series like this was needed.
However, based on the above comments I could tell this topic was worth
the writing effort.</p>
<p>I’ll spend some time baselining the discussion with term definitions
(“Feature”, “Data Modeling”, etc) as some folks in both the analytics
world and the machine learning world have different definitions for the
same concept, and it’s worth (attempting to build?) building a common
vernacular.</p>
<p>The challenge with this common vernacular is that it seems the
combination of “marketing teams jumping on the latest hot term” and
“twitter chatter” is a recipe for fuzzy definitions. Definitions and the
framing of concepts are where we need to start.</p>
<h2 id="revisting-the-framing-of-the-lab-and-the-factory">Revisting the
Framing of The Lab and the Factory</h2>
<p>Another theme I touch on in this series is revisting the idea of the
“Lab and the Factory”. I do active research with the University of
Michigan on modeling disaster data and its impact on healthcare. I help
researchers build out different exploratory data pipelines, and it
always was interesting in how, while we were still exploring data
product ideas, the tools that best fit the situation were quite
different than the tools that fit enterprise data analytics and machine
learning projects. Projects such as working with Universtiy researchers
is one of the core places that new ideas are born, implicitly embodying
the idea of the “lab”.</p>
<p>Many ideas, such as “The Lab and the Factory”, are used in talks and
discussion in a breezy manner, but many times lack specifics. (An
example of this is how I use the term “lab and the factory” in our
Kubeflow Operations Guide book in chapter 1, but never defining it
further in the book. I’m as guity as anyone here.)</p>
<p>Another framing of the data industry was “Data is the new oil”. This
framing didn’t work as well, as not all data was as useful to companies
(or they were unable to make use of it).</p>
<p>It’s worth grounding any data product analysis in the right framing,
to understand what worked — and what did not work.</p>

<p>“Data engineering refers to the building of systems to enable the

<p>Towels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A towel is just about the most massively useful thing an interstellar
hitchhiker can carry. Partly because it has great practical value. You
can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of
Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of
Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it
beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon;
use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use
in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it around your head to ward off noxious
fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a
mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can’t see it, it
can’t see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave
your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course you can
dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More
importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason,
if a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will
automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush,
washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string,
gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the
strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen
other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have “lost.” What the
strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of
the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win
through and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be
reckoned with.</p>
