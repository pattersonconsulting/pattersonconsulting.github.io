<p>Topics to reference</p>
<ul>
<li>unbundling of Airflow
<ul>
<li>rise of airflow, what it replaced, compared to Hadoop-infra</li>
</ul></li>
<li>rise of DBT
<ul>
<li>its hard to describe, a developer tool, and middleware — but its
super hot. and its hard to understand why.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>explosion of information
<ul>
<li>TVA project, PMU data — half petabyte hadoop cluster</li>
<li>we had to try non-MS-and-Oracle vendors because they didnt have the
features we needed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>as a platform gets bigger, moving data gets progressively harder,
and compute jobs get pulled into its orbit
<ul>
<li>data has gravity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>moving fast and having flexibility is a key driver of going to the

<h1 id="the-evolution-of-data-infrastructure">The Evolution of Data
Infrastructure</h1>
<p>Narrative and Ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the trend starting around 2008 to have “everything scale” –
hadoop, big data</li>
<li>story about Stonebraker telling Olson that “MapReduce wont work
out”</li>
<li>in terms of graphs/charts — need to talk about late 2000’s where
“big data” started to emerge with data growth</li>
<li>this data growth drives more BI tools, such as Tableau</li>
<li>setting the stage for a tool such as DBT to emerge, 7-8 years later
(2016)</li>
</ul>
<p>mention how you cannot “solve” a particular aspect of data
infrastructure, as it all continues to evolve</p>
<p>Why this version of the evolution of data platforms? why not just
rely on the existing writing of “Modern data stack”?</p>
<p>— because it misses the tectonic plates shifting</p>

<h3 id="data-platform-consolidation">Data Platform Consolidation</h3>
<p>When enterprises are exploring data platform consolidation, how are
they evaluating between cloud providers’ native offerings and
cloud-agnostic solutions or on-prem solutions?</p>
<p>Used to be theories that customers wanted open source But they just
wanted something that let them get rolling without a long sales pitch
Easy wins Cloudera didnt make Hadoop easy enough Databricks came along,
got cloud right Snowflake came along, made SQL even easier, focused on
that Now databricks playing catch up</p>

<ul>
<li>notes here about how they create a better multi-tenant factory
design
<ul>
<li>one critical change is “moving from just a bunch of files” to “a
logical data abstraction over the raw data”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>an understanding of the different data access patterns for analytics
processing vs machine learning compute/training</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-snowflake-got-really-really-right">What Snowflake Got
Really, Really, Right</h1>
<ul>
<li>free data ingest – barely think about it</li>
<li>multi-tenancy</li>
<li>ANSI-SQL compliance — just throw in your old code, and it will scale
as much as you need – you dont have to chance a thing</li>
<li>There are tons of SQL analysts, and a lot less programmers in the
world</li>
<li>caught the cloud wave at the right time</li>
<li>Hadoop ops was really hard</li>
</ul>
<p>Security? Handled. Maintenance? Near to zero. Managing different
environments (dev/qa/prod)? Piece of cake. Optimization and scaling?
Handled.</p>
<h2 id="snowflake-vs-databricks">Snowflake vs DataBricks</h2>
<p>https://benn.substack.com/p/the-end-of-big-data/comments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing that Snowflake did really well is they pitched a product
that anyone could buy. You’re an enterprise with tons of wild data
needs? Snowflake can help. You’re a mid sized business running SQL
Server? Snowflake can help. You’ve got an MySQL database and are looking
for your first analytical warehouse? Snowflake can help.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="platform-feature-convergence">Platform Feature Convergence</h2>
<p>Snowflake</p>
<ul>
<li>Snowflake introduced a python dataframe</li>
<li>effectively the same as PySpark dataframe API for spark</li>
<li>On purpose: to onboard spark users more easily</li>
</ul>
<p>Databricks</p>
<ul>
<li>Delta is basically OSS Snowflake, and since then, Databricks and
Snowflake have been slowly converging.</li>
<li>Finally in the last year or so Delta feels a lot like Snowflake
(with a nice UI, simplified SQL clusters like Snowflake warehouses,
etc.). So it really is a big, fast database that you can program with
python, scala, SQL.</li>
</ul>
<p>DB came along to be a “better hadoop”; it was Scala-first and
required programmers to think about parallelization</p>
<h1 id="emergence-of-dbt">Emergence of DBT</h1>
<ul>
<li>on paper, this tool took me a long time to make sense of
<ul>
<li>its complicated to explain</li>
<li>its middleware (confirm)</li>
<li>it seemingly is a feature of other projects — how is it its own
product?</li>
<li>it feels sorta like Oozie on Hadoop in terms of being a DAG
orchestrator</li>
</ul></li>
<li>what really dug at me was — how did DBT come to exist? what
conditions allowed this to happen? (SQL coming back en vogue, w scale
for free)</li>
<li>The evolution of data platforms created market conditions that were
just right for a product like DBT</li>
</ul>
<p>DBT is hot “standardizing their SQL transformation layers on dbt as
they moved their data warehousing to the cloud.” dbt is the framework
for modern cloud data warehouse development. It lets you build out a new
kind of data pipeline that was never practical before. All while
embracing today’s best data practices: encapsulate business logic, check
it into git, test your data, connect it in a DAG But dbt exists today
for a reason. Cloud data warehouses demanded a new way of working. dbt
met that need by doing all-in on SQL. The result is pretty cool.</p>
<h1 id="the-modern-data-stack">The Modern Data Stack</h1>
<p>provide a simple-ish definition</p>
<p>https://continual.ai/post/the-future-of-the-modern-data-stack</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>The Modern Data Stack commonly refers to a collection of technologies
that comprise a cloud-native data platform, generally leveraged to
reduce the complexity in running a traditional data platform. The
individual components are not fixed, but they typically include: A Cloud
Data Warehouse, such as Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, or Databricks
Delta Lake A Data Integration Service, such as Fivetran, Segment, or
Airbyte A ELT data transformation tool, almost certainly dbt A BI layer,
such as Looker or Mode A Reverse ETL tool, such as Census or
Hightouch</p>
<h2 id="key-capabilities">Key Capabilities</h2>
<p>https://continual.ai/post/the-future-of-the-modern-data-stack</p>
<p>Offered as a Managed Service:<br />
&gt; Requires no or minimal setup and configuration from users and
absolutely no engineering required. Users can get started today, and
it’s not a vapid marketing promise.</p>
<p>Centered around a Cloud Data Warehouse (CDW): &gt; Everything “just
works” off-the-shelf if companies use a popular CDW. By being
opinionated about where your data is, you eliminate messy integrations
and tools play well together.</p>
<p>Democratizes data via a SQL-Centric Ecosystem: &gt; Tools are built
for data/analytics engineers and business users. These users often know
the most about a company’s data, so it makes sense to try to upskill
them by giving them tools that speak their language.</p>
<p>Elastic Workloads: &gt; Pay for what you use. Scale up instantly to
handle large workloads. Money is the only scale limitation in the modern
cloud. &gt; Focus on Operational Workflows: &gt; Point-and-click tools
are nice for low-tech users, but it’s all kind of meaningless if there’s
not a viable path to production. Modern data stack tools are often built
with automation as a core competency.</p>
<h2 id="drivers-of-the-modern-data-stack">Drivers of the Modern Data
Stack</h2>
<p>JWills: https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/1522622572743073800</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my Cloudera days, I thought that people cared about open-source
principles. They do not. They cared that an open-source tool meant that
they could get stuff done w/o having to sit through a sales
presentation. This principle applies well beyond OSS- when we were
choosing an initial BI tool for Slack, Mode beat Tableau because Tableau
made us sit through a sales preso while Mode was just like “okay, here’s
the tool. Call us in 30 days if you want to keep it.” Second principle:
all technical decisions are easy until someone’s fingers touch a
keyboard, and then the Sunk Cost Principle comes into full effect. By
the time we had Tableau up and running, we had already built like 30+
dashboards in Mode. It was over.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-working-in-open-source-commercialization">What is
Working in Open Source Commercialization</h2>
<ul>
<li>open source as marketing driver for closed source cloud
applications</li>
<li>focus on “time to value” (less worried about cloud cost), want less
Ops overhead to get started/</li>
<li>need a faster close rate, something “under 18 months”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-topics">Other Topics</h3>
<p>Data Platform Consolidation:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent are enterprises interested in consolidating around a
single data platform vs. last year? * How are enterprises evaluating
between cloud providers’ native offerings and cloud-agnostic or on-prem
solutions as they explore data platform consolidation?</li>
<li>How is the current macro environment impacting enterprises’
decisions around data platforms, including migrations?</li>
<li>How is interest in generative AI impacting data platform decisions,
including interest in platform consolidation? * How is Databricks
positioned relative to other cloud data platforms, including
hyperscalers, to benefit from growth in generative AI workloads?</li>
</ul>
<p>Snowflake and/or Databricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the competitive landscape between Databricks and Snowflake
evolving?</li>
<li>To what extent are customers choosing just Snowflake or Databricks
vs. using both? * How has this changed over the past year?</li>
<li>How compelling are the competitive products released by Databricks
and Snowflake that target the others’ core capabilities? * For what
types of workloads do they compete? How well do they compete?</li>
<li>How have customer conversations around consolidating workloads on
Snowflake or Databricks changed over the past year?</li>
<li>How mission-critical are the workloads moving to Databricks and
Snowflake?</li>
<li>To what extent, and for what reasons, are workload migrations from
Teradata slowing? * Is the current macro environment impacting this
dynamic?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-few-predictions-going-forward">A Few Predictions Going
Forward</h1>
<h2 id="how-predictions-go-very-very-wrong">How Predictions Go Very,
Very, Wrong</h2>
<p>you cant see the full distribution of the market</p>
<p>often we make inaccurate forecasts based on samples of data that do
not represent the full distribution of the market</p>
<h2 id="the-red-queen-always-has-it-right">The Red Queen Always Has it
Right</h2>
<p>Banks in the 60s and computers, the 4-day week</p>
<p>We just do more</p>
<p>We are programmed to compete, to see over that horizon, and explore
new lands</p>
<h2 id="the-continued-dominance-of-sql">The Continued Dominance of
SQL</h2>
<p>Spark in decline, just as MapReduce before it</p>
<ul>
<li>analysts are sql-first</li>
<li>don’t ask folks to change what works</li>
<li>everyone has a DW – not everyone is doing “advanced analytics”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-continued-growth-of-snowflake">The Continued Growth of
Snowflake</h2>
<p>$SNOW vs $DBX No enterprise won’t have a cloud data warehouse Some
enterprises will not have an advanced analytic platform If you have a DW
You have the data And you dont have to do ETL</p>
