<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>In this appendix we breakdown the specific roles involved in
analytics and machine learning. There are many skills required of roles
in the data platform space and each role has some overlap with other
roles in terms of skills required. In the infographic below, we show a
comparison of the skills (rated 1-5 per skill per role) in a polar
plot:</p>

<p>Note: This diagram was inspired by a similar digram in the Data
Captain’s article <a
href="https://www.datacaptains.com/blog/guide-to-data-roles">“Guide to
Data roles”</a>.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow I breakdown specific details about each
role and what kind of tools are commonly used in the role.</p>
<h1 id="data-scientist">Data Scientist</h1>
<p>A data scientist is a professional who uses their skills in
statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, and data
visualization to extract insights from large and complex sets of data.
They possess technical skills in programming languages such as Python or
R, and data manipulation tools such as SQL and Excel. Additionally, they
must have strong communication skills to effectively present their
findings to non-technical stakeholders.</p>
<p>Data scientists work with data engineers to build machine learning
models based on datasets extracted from the data warehouse and from
other souces such as log files, tabular data in flat files, etc.</p>
<h2 id="common-data-scientist-tools-used">Common Data Scientist Tools
Used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks</li>
<li>Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, more</li>
<li>SAS</li>
<li>R</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="data-engineer">Data Engineer</h1>
<p>A data engineer is a professional who designs and builds the
infrastructure to store, process, and analyze large and complex data
sets. They work closely with data scientists to identify the data
requirements and ensure that the necessary data is available in a usable
format.</p>
<p>Data engineers are skilled in data architecture, database design, and
distributed systems. They are responsible for developing and
implementing data pipelines, transforming data into a usable format, and
loading it into a data warehouse. They also optimize data processing
systems to ensure efficiency and scalability.</p>
<p>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I joined Facebook in 2011 as a business intelligence engineer. By
the time I left in 2013, I was a data engineer.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wasn’t promoted or assigned to this new role. Instead, Facebook
came to realize that the work we were doing transcended classic business
intelligence. The role we’d created for ourselves was a new discipline
entirely.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, data engineers are highly technical professionals
responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure that
supports the analysis and interpretation of large and complex data
sets.</p>
<h1 id="machine-learning-engineer">Machine Learning Engineer</h1>
<p>A machine learning engineer is responsible for designing, building,
and deploying machine learning systems that can learn from and make
predictions on large and complex sets of data. They work closely with
data scientists to develop and implement machine learning algorithms and
are skilled in programming languages such as Python or Java, as well as
machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.</p>
<p>Machine learning engineers are responsible for selecting and
preparing data sets, tuning the parameters of machine learning models,
and designing and developing the software infrastructure needed to
support machine learning systems. They work with data scientists and
other stakeholders to identify business problems that can be solved with
machine learning and to deliver solutions that can provide business
value.</p>
<p>Overall, machine learning engineers are highly technical
professionals who are critical to the development and implementation of
machine learning systems.</p>
<h1 id="analytics-engineer">Analytics Engineer</h1>
<p>Analytics engineer is a role <a
href="https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/">defined by
DBT Labs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analytics engineers provide clean data sets to end users, modeling
data in a way that empowers end users to answer their own questions.
While a data analyst spends their time analyzing data, an analytics
engineer spends their time transforming, testing, deploying, and
documenting data. Analytics engineers apply software engineering best
practices like version control and continuous integration to the
analytics code base. &lt;!– Specific tasks include:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Provide clean, transformed data ready for analysis</li>
<li>apply software engineering best practices to analytics code (eg.,
version control, testing, continuous integration)</li>
<li>maintain data documentation and definitions</li>
<li>train business users on how to use data visualization tools</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-tools-used-by-an-analytics-engineer">Common Tools used by
an Analytics Engineer</h2>
<ul>
<li>GUI tools like SSIS to build ETL pipelines –&gt; # Data Analyst</li>
</ul>
<p>A data analyst is a professional who examines large and complex sets
of data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to
inform business decisions. They use statistical and analytical
techniques such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and data
visualization to extract insights from data. They are skilled in
programming languages such as SQL, Python, or R, and data manipulation
tools such as Excel or Tableau.</p>
<p>Data analysts are responsible for collecting and cleaning data,
preparing it for analysis, and presenting their findings to stakeholders
through reports or visualizations. They play a critical role in
informing business decisions by providing insights based on data
analysis. Overall, data analysts are highly analytical professionals who
are responsible for extracting insights from data and communicating
their findings to stakeholders.</p>
<p>DBT Labs has a <a
href="https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/">great
article comparing the Data Analyst role</a> with other data roles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While a data analyst spends their time analyzing data, an analytics
engineer spends their time transforming, testing, deploying, and
documenting data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analytics engineers apply software engineering best practices
like:</p>
<ul>
<li>version control</li>
<li>continuous integration</li>
</ul>
<p>to the analytics code base.</p>

contrasted to roles who “use the infrastructure”</li>
