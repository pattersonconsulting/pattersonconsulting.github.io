<p>Analytics engineer is a role <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/">defined by DBT Labs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analytics engineers provide clean data sets to end users, modeling data in a way that empowers end users to answer their own questions. While a data analyst spends their time analyzing data, an analytics engineer spends their time transforming, testing, deploying, and documenting data. Analytics engineers apply software engineering best practices like version control and continuous integration to the analytics code base.</p>

<h2 id="key-tasks-1">Key Tasks</h2>
<p>We list the key tasks for an analytics engineer from <a href="https://preset.io/blog/reshaping-data-engineering/">Preset’s blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>owning core datasets: as analytics engineers cover more specific subject areas, data engineers may cover the mission-critical datasets that are heavily shared across teams</li>
<li>data modeling: define and refine best practices around modeling data</li>
<li>coding standards: define and defend naming conventions, coding conventions, and testing standards.</li>
<li>abstractions: create and manage reusable components in the form of jinja macros libraries and computation frameworks</li>
<li>metadata management: data assets documentation, discoverability, metadata integration, etc</li>
<li>data operations: SLAs, data warehouse cost management, data quality monitoring, anomaly detection, and garbage collecting unused resources</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="data-analyst">Data Analyst</h1>
<p>A data analyst is a professional who examines large and complex sets of data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can be used to inform business decisions. They use statistical and analytical techniques such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization to extract insights from data. They are skilled in programming languages such as SQL, Python, or R, and data manipulation tools such as Excel or Tableau.</p>
<p>Data analysts are responsible for collecting and cleaning data, preparing it for analysis, and presenting their findings to stakeholders through reports or visualizations. They play a critical role in informing business decisions by providing insights based on data analysis. Overall, data analysts are highly analytical professionals who are responsible for extracting insights from data and communicating their findings to stakeholders.</p>
<p>DBT Labs has a <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering/">great article comparing the Data Analyst role</a> with other data roles:</p>

### Data Engineers vs Cloud DevOps

Data Engineer Role and Cloud DevOps Role are both critical roles in modern businesses that rely heavily on technology. Here are the key differences and similarities between these two roles:

Job Responsibilities:
Data Engineers are responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines that collect, process, and store large amounts of data. They are skilled in designing, building, and managing data storage systems and data processing infrastructure. They ensure that data is secure, easily accessible, and of high quality.

Cloud DevOps, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the cloud infrastructure that runs an organization's applications. They work on automating the deployment, scaling, and management of applications on the cloud infrastructure. They ensure the cloud infrastructure is secure, cost-efficient, and always available.

Skills Required:
Data Engineers need to have a strong foundation in computer science, database systems, and data modeling. They should be skilled in programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Java. Additionally, they need to have expertise in ETL (extract, transform, load) processes, data warehousing, and big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark.

Cloud DevOps require skills in cloud computing, containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible. They should be proficient in scripting languages like Bash, Python, and PowerShell. Additionally, they need to have strong skills in CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment), monitoring, and logging tools.

Tools and Technologies:
Data Engineers work with data storage technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, and DynamoDB. They also use data processing frameworks like Apache Beam and Apache Kafka. Additionally, they use data modeling tools like ERwin and ER/Studio.

Cloud DevOps use cloud computing platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. They use containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to deploy applications. They also use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible. Additionally, they use CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI.

In summary, Data Engineers and Cloud DevOps are both critical roles in modern businesses that rely heavily on technology. The key differences between these two roles are in their job responsibilities, required skills, and the tools and technologies they use. However, they share some similarities in their roles, such as working to ensure security and availability of the organization's technology infrastructure.
