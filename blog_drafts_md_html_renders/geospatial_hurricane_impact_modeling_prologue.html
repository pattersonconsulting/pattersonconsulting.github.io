<p>AMS invited talk</p>
<p>Started out with a few counties of data Couldnt find relationships
Then moved to a lot more counties worth of data Found some of the spikes
we were looking for But realized there was a larger story Then moved to
looking at a 5-7 states worth of data For admissions Added per-county
storm data in Found compelling results in the analysis</p>
<p>Talked these results over with another data expert They pointed out:
Storm (N=1) Difficult to draw any generalizations when N = 1 Now we know
we needed to look at 20 years worth of storm data And as much admission
data as we could get our hands on Our geospatial system needed to be
more robust</p>

<p>Maps @ UM Research Not traditional EDA But we still need some custom
visualization Possibly could have used ERSI for the geospatial or
another traditional GIS tool But those tend to be locked down And we
started from a data-centric perspective, operating with python, and then
later on bringing in GIS components The open source world has added a
lot of functionality that was traditionally in tools such as ERSI</p>

Computer science We also needed a way to let multiple people work on the

then became a series of notebooks Soon the data processing pipeline was
long and un-weldy And calculated the metrics for admission data and
storm data slightly differently over time Making comparison of results
more difficult too</p>

<h2 id="key-challenges-faced-by-cities-today">Key Challenges Faced by
Cities Today</h2>
<p>The core challenges faced by the managers and operators of urban
centers today are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population Growth</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Operational Costs</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Building Codes, Infrastructure, and Compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these challenges can be measured through data yet many today
are not managed effectively. Population growth in urban centers is a key
driver towards more managed solutions for other aspects of city
management such as traffic.</p>
<p>In the following sub-sections we take a look at published research on
each of these challenges.</p>
<h3 id="population-growth">Population Growth</h3>
<p>Many research papers and studies show a strong trend of population
movement into major cities as expressed in the passage below from the
University of Michigan:</p>
<p>http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/us-cities-factsheet</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Approximately 84% of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, up
from 64% in 1950. By 2050, 89% of the U.S. population and 68% of the
world population is projected to live in urban areas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another publication states the following:</p>
<p>https://graylinegroup.com/urbanization-catalyst-overview/</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United Nations in 2009 and the International Organization for
Migration in 2015 both estimated that around 3 million people are moving
to cities every week. Approximately 54% of people worldwide now live in
cities, up from 30% in 1950. Sources estimate this will grow to 2/3 of
world population in the next 15-30 years. More than half of urban
dwellers live in the 1,022 cities with greater than 500,000 inhabitants.
There are currently 29 megacities with populations of over 10 million,
up from 2 in 1950 and projected to grow to between 41 and 53 by 2030.
Additionally, there are 468 cities with a population of over 1 million,
up from 83 in 1950.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UN website goes on to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a
proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show
that urbanization, the gradual shift in residence of the human
population from rural to urban areas, combined with the overall growth
of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban
areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia
and Africa, according to a new United Nations data set launched
today.“”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="growth-factors-of-cities">Growth Factors of cities</h4>
<p>Some of the drivers of the growth of city population size include:

<p>Top listed challenges from the “What Challenges Must We Address?”
report:
<a href="http://www.trca.on.ca/dotAsset/164995.pdf">http://www.trca.on.ca/dotAsset/164995.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two million more people: Provincial plans anticipate that the
population of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) will grow by approximately
two million people over the next 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>New housing and infrastructure required: This will require the
construction of new housing, institutional and commercial supports,
transportation systems, and servicing infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pace of rapid urbanization: Rapid urbanization will present
environmental, social and traffic congestion challenges, which can
impose costs on residents and businesses alike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another report identifies:
<a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialplanningtoronto/pages/574/attachments/original/1487348389/Report-v4-web.pdf?1487348389">https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialplanningtoronto/pages/574/attachments/original/1487348389/Report-v4-web.pdf?1487348389</a></p>
<p>Major concerns around this growth are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Gentrification</li>
<li>Lack of affordable housing</li>
<li>Transit</li>
<li>Lack of amenities and greenspace</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operational-costs">Operational Costs</h3>
<p>Cities are progressively finding it harder to manage the higher
operational burden with the same resources as before: “Recent
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money">research</a>
into the tax efficiency (property tax revenues vs. infrastructure
maintenance costs) of a variety of American cities and found that
walkable urban districts tended to be revenue-positive – in effect,
subsidizing surrounding low-density areas”
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money">https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/1/9/the-real-reason-your-city-has-no-money</a></p>
<h4 id="fiscal-issues-facing-the-operations-of-cities">Fiscal Issues
Facing the Operations of Cities</h4>
<p>As cities become more complex, costs are outpacing tax revenue: “One
evident problem is fiscal: Cities typically have serious difficulties in
paying for basic services such as policing, public education, trash
removal, street maintenance, and snow removal (at least in cold
climates), and in providing certain services for their residents who are
poor or disabled or who have other conditions. “</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>Planning is compelling to look at from a historical perspective.
Appendix A of this report shows a table with the largest cities in
history over the past 9,000 years. We can see a trend of cities hitting
a progressively larger size plateau over time. In this sub-section on
planning we take a look at some of the historical aspects of city
infrastructure, building codes, and failures of major cities.</p>
<h4 id="historical-sanitation-and-issues-with-a-growing-city">Historical
Sanitation and Issues with a Growing City</h4>
<p>For a many hundreds of years core sanitation practices limited the
size of cities as plagues and disease continually restricted the growth
of urban centers through killing off large portions of the population,
as discussed in the following quote:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/plague-and-the-city/">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/plague-and-the-city/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When the Black Death, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, swept
across Europe it killed over 1/3 of the population. This level of
destruction is almost impossible to imagine today (particularly given
that one third of the population of Europe today would be around 250
million people). One of the things that helped the bacteria to thrive
was the conditions that the cities encouraged. Yersinia infects fleas,
which travel on rats and huge populations of rats could be found in
every major city in Europe. Often I suspect, they outnumbered the
people. It wasn't just rats either, cities were crammed with animals
including sheep, goats and pigs. Animals and humans in close proximity
creates a breeding ground for zoonotic diseases, which can be highly
deadly when they switch species.“</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not only are cities a good way to put humans and animals in close
contact, they are also notorious for ill-health and bad living
conditions compared to nomadic lifestyles. Water has to be brought in
and shared around between many people. Overcrowding is common, as are
disease vectors such as fleas and bed-bugs that can carry bacteria
between humans. With the bad conditions, the close cramped living
conditions and the complete lack of understanding of germ theory it's no
wonder the disease swept through Europe until pretty much everyone had
either died or survived.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Before the development of cities bacterial diseases would have been
present (cystitis springs to mind…) but the virulent and decimating
plague-bearing diseases were unlikely to have arisen, or if they did
there was no way for them to spread so far. Hunter gatherer populations
did face hardships but on general they ate better and more regularly,
got more exercise, and drank water that they were pretty certain was not
contaminated. Cities might provide protection, and a solid base for
trade and economic infrastructure, but they are also a brilliant way to
encourage bacteria to grow and spread disease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While cities were attracting people with protection and economic
infrastructure, but city planning had not yet caught up to operating a
city of that size. We can also see a list of the worst pandemics in
history:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/">https://www.mphonline.org/worst-pandemics-in-history/</a></p>
<p>And then “How The Black Death moved around the world”:
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The third great wave of plague began in China’s Yunnan province in
1894, emerged in Hong Kong and then spread via shipping routes
throughout the world. It reached the United States through a plague ship
from Hong Kong that docked at Hawaii, where plague broke out in December
1899, and then San Francisco, whose plague epidemic began in March
1900.” Beyond sanitation issues, there we also issues packing that many
buildings closely together without consistent building rules.</p>

<p>To grow larger, cities had to change how they were built with better
building codes and better operations.</p>
<h4
id="the-evolution-of-building-codes-and-compliance-to-allow-larger-cities">The
Evolution of Building Codes and Compliance to Allow Larger Cities</h4>
<p>In response to such issues as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plagues</li>
<li>Fires</li>
<li>Earthquakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Cities began to change how they wrote their building codes and
operated their cities. Development of basic potable water handling and
sanitation codes helping clean up cities:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/5/17-1609_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/5/17-1609_article</a></p>
<p>A need for public health standards:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/medicine/disease/disease5.php">https://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/medicine/disease/disease5.php</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Within three decades of establishment of the Board of Health, better
regulation to ensure sanitary drinking water had begun to reduce
instances of diseases such as hookworm, and more effective quarantining
and more extensive state-run stations had allowed the state to limit the
spread of yellow fever epidemics.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many cases, changing building codes proved to be a valuable
endeavor:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/the-value-and-impact-of-building-codes">https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/the-value-and-impact-of-building-codes</a></p>
<p>In some cases, “some buildings are too expensive to change”, but
cities were still able to raise the ceiling of maximum operating size
with better codes and design. Urban planning and sanitation became key
to building the major urban centers we see today.</p>
<h4
id="technology-as-a-mechanism-for-larger-cities-aqueducts">Technology as
a Mechanism for Larger Cities: Aqueducts</h4>
<p>Lastly, we’ll note how infrastructure advancements (such as the Roman
aqueducts) notably enabled certain cities to grow to previously unseen
sizes:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/roman-aqueducts/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/roman-aqueducts/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p> “The Romans could not have built cities as big as they did without
aqueducts—and some of their cities wouldn't have existed at all. Romans
sometimes built cities on dry plains. They'd find a spring in the
mountains and take that water into the city, which would not have been
possible without the transported water. With the water, they could have
their baths, their fountains, and their drinking water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It also would be impossible to imagine Rome, which had about
1,000,000 people at its peak, without its large aqueducts. The Romans
could have obtained their water from the river, wells, and springs, but
these sources would have become polluted in a large city.”</p>

<h3 id="municipal-use-cases-and-models-of-utility">Municipal Use Cases
and Models of Utility</h3>
<p>The 3 models of utility to consider when framing municipal use
cases:</p>
<p>User-Based Insurance Example: “lowering a city’s insurance costs
through monitoring / code compliance” Applications that save a city
money Example: “Quantify and Prioritize Repairs” Applications that
mitigate a city’s operational risk Example “Reviewing historical data to
understand the cause of adverse events”</p>
<h3 id="the-municipal-operating-system">The Municipal Operating
System</h3>
<p>For cities to meet the demands of growth, they will have to be
consumed by software</p>
<p>The City Operating System Nobody loves city codes But they power
cities of our current epoch Without standards, we would have to abandon
major cities Continuing the framing, make the case for data and
analytics as the operating system of next generation cities Red queen
demands it</p>
<p>Relate to how ML use cases make us “just efficient enough” to meet
demand</p>

<p>Closing As cities grow, they become more interconnected Cite flight
statistics A trip across a city now becomes a trip across the country to
another city If we can look at cities as needing management / OS to meet
demand Then by extension we have to consider a network cities as a
logical unit in the 21st century Covid / Pandemics Climate Change
Pandemics and global coordinated resource management will be the
challenge of smart city 2.0</p>
