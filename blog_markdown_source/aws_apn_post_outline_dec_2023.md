Below is the outline for the article.

# Section 1: Introduction

* At AWS Re:Invent 2023 there were many new announcements in the realm of Generative AI
* AWS Bedrock is quickly emerging as a go to platform for deploying Generative AI applications
* One key requirement to operate private appliations will be the need to use private models (e.g., "not openAI")


# Section 2: Relation to AWS

* Bedrock has --- stuff, stuff, stuff --- give details here
* We want to think about LLM applications in the terms of "knowledge vs reasoning", where our enterprise data in AWS is the knowledge, and LLM models provide the reasoning
* We use the RAG design pattern to connect our private knowledge with the reasoning power of LLMs to build next-gen AI apps on AWS



# Section 3: Challenge

* Choosing the correct private model, however, can be tricky
* openAI has powerful models such as GPT3 and GPT4, but these models are difficult to run as private LLM model isntances
* smaller private models typically are more efficient to operate, but they have less horsepower in certain types of reasoning
* To build efficient, cost-effective AI applications we need a way to compare different models for our specific tasks with our data



# Section 4: Solution

* Patterson Consulting has led the development of the open source tool called the "Reasoning Workbench"
* the Reasoning Workbench is an easy and direct way to generate scores to compare different models 
* it also allows you to generate comparative scores for prompts specific to your enterprise as well
* this tool can you quickly get a relative sense/measure for which model works best for your sepecific AI application


# Section 5: Benefit

* being able to quickly pick the best model for your use case allows your team to act quickly and decisively deploy new AI apps with confidence
* better models are less costly to operate (less tokens)
* applications require less prompt engineering, which allows us to do fewer inferences to our private models
* all of the above gives the end user a faster and more efficient user experience


# Section 6: Call to Action

* sign up today for a private demo and brainstorming session with the reasoning workbench
* Patterson Consulting also offers free use case analysis sessions for select AWS customers
