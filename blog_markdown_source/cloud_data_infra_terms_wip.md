# Fact Table

In a data warehouse, a fact table is a central table that stores quantitative data about a particular business process or activity. It is used to record the various measures or metrics that are relevant to the process, such as sales revenue, customer orders, product returns, website clicks, or any other measurable data point that can help organizations make informed business decisions.

The fact table typically contains foreign keys that link to the dimensions, which are descriptive attributes of the process, such as time, location, product, customer, or any other aspect that can help organize and filter the data. By joining the fact table with the dimension tables, analysts can perform various types of queries and analyses, such as aggregating data by different dimensions, slicing and dicing the data, comparing trends over time, or drilling down to specific details.

Fact tables are designed to be optimized for querying and reporting, and can be partitioned, indexed, or aggregated to improve performance. They are often the largest tables in a data warehouse, and are updated frequently with new data from various sources. The design and structure of a fact table depend on the specific business requirements and the type of analysis that needs to be performed.




# Dimension Table

In a data warehouse, a dimension table is a table that contains descriptive attributes that provide context for the quantitative data in the fact table. A dimension table provides information about the various aspects of a business process or activity that can help organize and filter the data, such as time, location, product, customer, or any other dimension that is relevant to the business.

The dimension table contains a primary key that is used as a foreign key in the fact table to establish a relationship between the two tables. By joining the fact table with the dimension tables, analysts can perform various types of queries and analyses, such as aggregating data by different dimensions, slicing and dicing the data, comparing trends over time, or drilling down to specific details.

Dimension tables are designed to be relatively small, with a few columns and many rows, and are optimized for read performance. They are typically updated less frequently than the fact table, as they contain descriptive attributes that do not change as often. The design and structure of a dimension table depend on the specific business requirements and the type of analysis that needs to be performed.
