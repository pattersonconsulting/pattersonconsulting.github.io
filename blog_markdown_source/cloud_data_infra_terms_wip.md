In a data warehouse, a fact table is a central table that stores quantitative data about a particular business process or activity. It is used to record the various measures or metrics that are relevant to the process, such as sales revenue, customer orders, product returns, website clicks, or any other measurable data point that can help organizations make informed business decisions.
