# What are LLMs

todo

## Deep Learning

todo

* DL is about automated feature learning

## Generative Language Models

todo

* refernece our strata talk in 2016

## Transformers

todo

* dont need to create features
* can use tons of data
* can use tons of parameters

## GPT Architecture

* based on transformers
* doesnt need feature engineering
* just give it structured set of natural language
