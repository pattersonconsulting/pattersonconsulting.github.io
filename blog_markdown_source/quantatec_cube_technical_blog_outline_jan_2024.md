# Prompts and Instructions


You are a smart business analyst and writer. The reader is a technical founder or VP of Engineering. You are writing an article for a technical Blog.

Below is the outline for the article.

# Section 1: Introduction

* More end-users than ever on knowledge work platforms
* Training new users is expensive and takes time
* adding a natural language interface for any analytics product can reduce training time and enhance productivity

# Section 2: Market Trends


* Large Language Models are emerging as a key driver of next-generation applications
   * generate human-like text, answer questions, assist with language translation, write code, summarize article, create conversational agents
   * Enterprise value of LLM application is often increased by incorporating knowledge of the enterprise data (database lookup, document review).

* Why invest in LLM for reasoning applications in 2024
   * LLM impact for enterprise on productivity, marketshare, profitability
   * Enterprise risk and cost of inaction, Can late adopters catch up


* We use the RAG design pattern to connect our private knowledge with the reasoning power of LLMs to build next-gen AI applications


# Section 3: Challenges

* Designing user interfaces for applications can be expensive, and it requires end users to be trained for the specific application
* In some cases analysts are expected to know a programming language
* SQL has the broadest adoption in the analyst crowd because it is the easiest to use 
* However, training large numbers of new users on SQL can be time consuming and expensive too

# Section 4: Using LLMs to build Natural Language User Interfaces

* we can provide plain english answers to plain english questions from end users
* we do this by integrating LLMs with private analytical data
* the LLMs provide the analysis and reasoning of the plain english questions
* the LLMs can reason about what type of information is needed for this question
* the LLMs can then write a plain english answer based on the private data extract to satisfy the original question


Write 1-2 paragraphs for section 2 of the article based on the outline above. Your audience is a technical VP of Engineering in Fortune 500 companies.
