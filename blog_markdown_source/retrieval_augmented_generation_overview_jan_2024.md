# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?


In the fast-evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs), leveraging user-specific data is a critical element for enhancing the effectiveness and personalization of applications. Many LLM applications necessitate insights beyond their pre-existing training set, prompting the adoption of innovative techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This methodology bridges the gap between model capabilities and user-specific information, ensuring a more tailored and responsive user experience.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a design pattern that combines elements of both retrieval-based and generative models to enhance the capabilities of natural language understanding and generation in AI systems. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in building next-generation AI applications, as mentioned in your article outline.

Here's a breakdown of Retrieval Augmented Generation:

1. **Retrieval Mechanism:**
   - RAG starts with a retrieval mechanism that searches for pertinent information from external databases, APIs, or knowledge bases.
   - This retrieval is based on the context and requirements of the user query, ensuring that the additional data is contextually relevant.

   note: give a concrete example of this

2. **Generative Models:**
   - Generative models are capable of creating new content, such as generating human-like text, answering questions, or even creating original pieces of writing.
   - These models exhibit creativity and the ability to generate content beyond what is explicitly present in the training data.

3. **Integration with Generation:**
   - Once the external data is retrieved, it is seamlessly integrated into the LLM's generation process.
   - This integration enables the model to utilize both its pre-existing knowledge and the dynamically acquired information for a more context-aware response.

4. **Adaptive Contextual Understanding:**
   - By incorporating retrieval into the generation process, RAG enhances the contextual understanding of the AI system. It allows the model to leverage existing knowledge effectively while generating responses.
   - RAG enables dynamic adaptation to diverse user inputs by allowing the LLM to constantly update its knowledge base with real-time or personalized data.
   - This adaptability ensures that the model evolves with changing user needs and contexts.

5. **Applications:**
   - RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where precise and context-aware responses are required, such as question answering, conversational agents, or content summarization.
   - It is widely applied in natural language interfaces, where the AI system needs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and generate appropriate responses.

In the context of your article's outline, mentioning the use of the RAG design pattern signifies that your approach involves integrating private knowledge with the reasoning power of LLMs, likely combining retrieval of relevant information with the generative capabilities of these models to build advanced AI applications with improved contextual understanding and response generation.

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a strategic approach employed to integrate external, user-specific data into the process of generating responses or content with large language models. Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely solely on their training data, RAG allows these models to dynamically fetch relevant information from external sources during the generation phase.



note: segue into "knowledge vs reasoning", how does that relate to RAG?


## Knowledge vs Reasoning

Letâ€™s review the core ideas of knowledge and reasoning:

* Knowledge provides the foundation and raw material for reasoning. It serves as a basis for making informed decisions, solving problems, and understanding the world. Knowledge provides context and background information that can be used in the reasoning process.
* Reasoning employs logical and cognitive processes to analyze and manipulate knowledge. It helps in organizing, connecting, and utilizing knowledge to derive new insights, solve problems, make judgments, and make predictions.

Knowledge is a prerequisite for effective reasoning. Reasoning heavily relies on the availability and accuracy of relevant knowledge. Lack of knowledge can limit the quality and accuracy of reasoning. However, reasoning can operate even in the absence of complete knowledge. It can make use of partial or incomplete information to draw conclusions or make decisions. Reasoning can also be employed to fill gaps in knowledge and acquire new knowledge.

Knowledge and reasoning are interrelated cognitive processes. Knowledge provides the information and foundation for reasoning, while reasoning employs logical and cognitive processes to manipulate knowledge and arrive at conclusions. Knowledge represents accumulated information, while reasoning is a dynamic process of drawing inferences and making decisions based on available information.

## Why is RAG Important?

* eh?

1. **Enhanced Decision Support:**
   - End users often deal with complex and rapidly changing business scenarios. RAG empowers LLM applications to provide more nuanced and informed responses by incorporating the latest market trends, industry news, and company-specific data.

2. **Personalized Communication:**
   - RAG facilitates personalized communication by considering user-specific information. This is particularly beneficial when addressing individualized queries, making interactions more meaningful and relevant.

3. **Improved Problem-Solving:**
   - In dynamic business environments, quick and accurate decision-making is crucial. RAG equips LLMs with the ability to fetch real-time data, aiding managers and VPs in solving problems efficiently.


# Different Types of RAG

* TODO
* cover: is RAG only used with Vector Databases????
* different types of retrieval methods (code branch detection, manually writing sql, etc)

https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/

note: we should answer concretely: "Are there variations of RAG that do not use embeddings and vector stores? "

# RAG Enhanced with the Semantic Layer

* differentiate "augmenting generation" with "retrieving data"
* querying vector databases with embeddings via similarity queries is not RAG, but is part of the retrieval process
* JP will write this section
