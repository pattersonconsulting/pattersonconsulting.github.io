# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a design pattern that combines elements of both retrieval-based and generative models to enhance the capabilities of natural language understanding and generation in AI systems. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application in building next-generation AI applications, as mentioned in your article outline.

Here's a breakdown of Retrieval Augmented Generation:

1. **Retrieval-Based Models:**
   - Retrieval-based models focus on retrieving relevant information from a predefined set of data or knowledge sources.
   - These models excel at providing accurate and contextually appropriate responses by selecting and presenting information directly from the existing data.

2. **Generative Models:**
   - Generative models, on the other hand, are capable of creating new content, such as generating human-like text, answering questions, or even creating original pieces of writing.
   - These models exhibit creativity and the ability to generate content beyond what is explicitly present in the training data.

3. **Combining Retrieval and Generation:**
   - Retrieval Augmented Generation seeks to combine the strengths of both retrieval and generative models. It typically involves a two-step process.
   - Firstly, a retrieval step identifies and retrieves relevant information or context from a knowledge base or dataset.
   - Subsequently, a generative step utilizes this retrieved information to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response or output.

4. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:**
   - By incorporating retrieval into the generation process, RAG enhances the contextual understanding of the AI system. It allows the model to leverage existing knowledge effectively while generating responses.

5. **Applications:**
   - RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where precise and context-aware responses are required, such as question answering, conversational agents, or content summarization.
   - It is widely applied in natural language interfaces, where the AI system needs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and generate appropriate responses.

In the context of your article's outline, mentioning the use of the RAG design pattern signifies that your approach involves integrating private knowledge with the reasoning power of LLMs, likely combining retrieval of relevant information with the generative capabilities of these models to build advanced AI applications with improved contextual understanding and response generation.
