<!--
              Knowledge work, a term first coined by Peter Drucker in 1959, refers to work that primarily involves thinking, problem-solving, and the creation or application of information. 

              Drucker defined knowledge workers as individuals who apply theoretical and analytical knowledge, acquired through formal training, to develop products and services. 

              He argued that the most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution, whether business or non-business, would be its knowledge workers and their productivity. 

              Drucker later considered knowledge worker productivity to be the next frontier of management. 

-->

Knowledge work, as introduced by Peter Drucker in 1959, involves primarily intellectual tasks such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and the application of specialized knowledge acquired through formal training. Drucker recognized knowledge workers as the most vital resource in modern organizations due to their role in developing products and services. He further identified knowledge worker productivity as the next major management challenge, underscoring the importance of strategically leveraging these professionals’ expertise to drive institutional success.

            <p class="fs-lg">
<!--
Nonaka (1991)[16] described knowledge as the fuel for innovation, but was concerned that many managers failed to understand how knowledge could be leveraged. Companies are more like living organisms than machines, he argued, and most viewed knowledge as a static input to the corporate machine. Nonaka advocated a view of knowledge as renewable and changing, and that knowledge workers were the agents for that change. Knowledge-creating companies, he believed, should be focused primarily on the task of innovation.
-->
Nonaka (1991) emphasizes that knowledge should be viewed as a dynamic, evolving resource rather than a static input. He asserts that organizations, more akin to living organisms than mechanical systems, thrive by actively renewing and transforming knowledge. Central to this approach is the role of knowledge workers, who act as catalysts for innovation and continuous improvement.
            </p>

The idea of knowledge management evolved in the 1990s to support knowledge workers with standard tools and processes.

Savage (1995) describes a knowledge-focus as the third wave of human socio-economic development. The first wave was the Agricultural Age with wealth defined as ownership of land. In the second wave, the Industrial Age, wealth was based on ownership of Capital, i.e. factories. In the Knowledge Age, wealth is based upon the ownership of knowledge and the ability to use that knowledge to create or improve goods and services. Product improvements include cost, durability, suitability, timeliness of delivery, and security. Using data,[citation needed] in the Knowledge Age, 2% of the working population will work on the land, 10% will work in Industry and the rest will be knowledge workers.
-->
Savage (1995) positions the knowledge-centric era as the third major socio-economic wave, following agriculture and industry. In this era, wealth is tied to owning and applying knowledge to create or enhance products and services, encompassing factors like cost, durability, suitability, timeliness, and security. Projections indicate only 2% of the workforce remains in agriculture and 10% in industry, leaving the majority as knowledge workers.

Raw data comes into an organization. A division processes the raw data into information that resides in a data platform. (relate to “lab and the factory”)
-->
              All of these definitions talk about generally what type of work is done in knowledge work, but none specifically dilineate who does knowledge work and who does not. To build this definition, we need to first define the input ("information") and how it is different from raw data. Then we can frame other variables in roles that measure how much knowledge work is being performed.


              

            </p>
            


            <h2 class="h4 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Data</h2>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              Data can be in the form of numbers, text, images, or any other type of input. It refers to raw, unorganized facts or figures that are collected and stored in some type of information platform. Some examples of data include:


       </p>

<ul>

<li>A spreadsheet containing sales figures</li>
<li>A database with customer records</li>
<li>Temperature readings from a weather station</li>
<li>GPS coordinates from a mobile device</li>

</ul>

 
            <p class="fs-lg">

              Data can be messy, scattered, and independent, making it less immediately useful. By itself, data lacks context and meaning. 

              Most people in an organization don't work with raw data, at least not in non-trivial ways. Data is the most basic form of representation and requires further processing to become useful. Most of the time data first needs to be joined with other data, aggregated from multiple external parties, or multiple internal systems into a logical information source.
              

            </p>     


           <p class="fs-lg">

By structuring and organizing data (such as transforming a series of sales figures into a statement about sales performance) organizations create information that is both interpretable and actionable. This transformation is vital in industries such as the insurance industry, where meaningful insights drawn from data can guide strategic decisions and ultimately lead to improved risk management, pricing, and customer relations.
            </p>



            <h2 class="h4 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Information</h2>


            <p class="fs-lg">

Information is the processed and organized form of data. It is data that has been analyzed, structured, and given context. Information provides meaning and can be used to answer questions or make decisions. 

It is the result of data being transformed into a more meaningful and useful state.    


            </p>     

            <ul>
              <li>A sales report highlighting top-selling products</li>
              <li>An article summarizing research findings</li>
              <li>A graph showing the correlation between two variables</li>


            </ul>    

            <p class="fs-lg">
Data and information are closely related but serve distinct functions in any organizational context. Data typically consists of raw and unrefined numbers, symbols, or characters that lack a clear purpose on their own. For example, figures such as “10,” “blue,” or “A” are merely data points unless they are given context. Information, on the other hand, emerges when these data points are organized and contextualized. In this sense, it has inherent value because it supports decision-making, provides insight, and can be used to form knowledge.
            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              Workers who create value in the core line of business use information, not raw data, as their input. Processing raw data into information is a function of IT (data engineering, data warehouse teams) and is not logically part of the role responsibilities in the medical field, insurance industry, or the banking industry.

              “From a practical perspective, we define knowledge as information in action. Until people take information and use it, it isn't knowledge.

<!--
            <p class="fs-lg">
The term 'knowledge work' appeared in The Landmarks of Tomorrow (1959) by Peter Drucker.[12] Drucker later coined the term 'knowledge worker' in The Effective Executive[13] in 1966. Later, in 1999, he suggested that "the most valuable asset of a 21st-century institution, whether business or non-business, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity."[14]

            <p class="fs-lg">

            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              So if we broaden our definition for knowledge work, we can state our role classification process such as:

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>a worker takes information (visual, written, digital) in as input to consider</li>
              <li>the worker asses the input against their internal state and accumulated knowledge <b>(e.g., "information processing", "cognitive labor")</b></li>
              <li>the worker then produces output based on instructions in the form of
                <ul>
                  <li>a physical action or physical labor (not knowledge work)</li>
                  <li>outputs new information that is based on the input and their existing internal knowledge (<b>is knowledge work</b>)</li>

                </ul>

              </li>
              <li>In the case of outputing new information, this may either be input information for someone else, or input to their own next cognitive task </li>



            </ul>



            <p class="fs-lg">

              To summarize, if someone is not actively producing physical labor but they are <b>processing information</b> and outputing information to be used in other tasks or by other people, then that is our minimal definition for knowledge work.

            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              More simply: "knowledge work is cognitive labor that takes information as input and outputs more information"

            </p>

            <h2 class="h3 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Roles that are Not Knowledge Work</h2>


            <p class="fs-lg">

              Examples of not knowledge work (e.g., "physical labor")

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Forklift operator</li>
              <li>Concrete mixing operator</li>
              <li>Bricklayer</li>

            </ul>


            <p class="fs-lg">

              Note that all 3 economic roles above, while valuable in their own right, use information (e.g, "sight", "written instructions") to produce physical labor outputs as their way to create value.

            </p>

            <h2 class="h3 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Roles that are Knowledge Work</h2>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              Examples of knowledge work (e.g., "cognitive labor")

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>claims analyst in an insurance company</li>
              <li>family practice doctor</li>
              <li>accountant</li>

            </ul>            


            <p class="fs-lg">

              The above 3 knowledge work examples don't perform cognitive labor in the same amounts as one another, but none of them have "physical labor output" as their primary way to be productive and create value.

            </p>

            



            <h2 class="h4 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Baselining with Economic Data</h2>

            <p class="fs-lg"> 

              The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes many wonderful datasets on the United States economy. They also write many reports analyzing this data, such as <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-10/minds-at-work-whats-required-according-to-the-occupational-requirements-survey.htm">bls.gov: Minds at Work - whats required according to the occupdational requirements survey</a> where they gather economic data and analyze the "Cognitive and mental requirements" of every role in the U.S. economy.

            </p>



            <p class="fs-lg"> 

              These measurements are meant to quantify things such as:

            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>"How much problem-solving time goes into an architect’s job?"</li>
              <li>"What types of mental capabilities are required of employees who work in a telework environment?"</li>
              <li>"What types of interpersonal skills are required for customer service jobs?"</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="fs-lg"> 

              While they aren't specifically using the term "knowledge work" in this study, it is a data-based economic survey that  measures "Cognitive and mental requirements" of each role in the U.S. economy. I consider this to be the best proxy variables available for a data-driven analysis on the subject.

            </p>

            <h2 class="h4 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Measuring Knowledge Work per Role and Industry</h2>



            <p class="fs-lg"> 

              Per economic role, (based on the variables listed below), I calculated a knowledge work factor per role (0.0 to 1.0) to get a relative measure on how much knowledge work is in a given role. (note: not perfect, but still "better than arbitrary definitions" and it gives us a relative measure to compare any role in the economy.)

            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Problem solving: Percent of workers, problem solving is required more than once per day</li>
              <li>Education, training, and experience: Percent of workers, minimum education level is a bachelor's degree</li>
              <li>Public interaction and people skills: Percent of workers, with more than basic people skills
              <li>Able to step away from work: Percent of workers, with the ability to pause work</li>
              <li>Telework: Percent of workers, with the ability to work remotely</li>
            </ol>


            <p class="fs-lg"> 

              Once we have a knowledge work score for every role, we then create a industry sector by weighting each role's impact on the industry score by what percent of total employment for the given role for a given industry sector.

            </p>



            <p class="fs-lg pb-4">

              In the table below we extend our "structural transformation" table to show our calculation for knowledge work measure per NAICS industry sector.



            </p>


            <figure class="figure">
              <img class="figure-img rounded-0 mb-3" src="../../assets/img/hhgtksw_kw_industry_sector_scores.png" alt="Image">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption">Knowledge work score per NAICS Industry Sector/Group</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p class="fs-lg">

              As stated above by Mosco and McKercher (2007), under a broader definition of knowledge work we might consider all jobs to have some component of information processing to them. Under that lens we then want to compare every sector to one another with respect to how much knowledge work is performed.


              This "knowledge work"-score per industry sector allows us to see a relative score for "how many people have roles that score high in the 'knowledge work' attributes". 
              
            </p>



            <h2 class="h2 mb-lg-4 pt-3 pt-md-4 pt-xl-5">Knowledge Work as Information Transformation</h2>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              
              In this article I've framed knowledge work as something that is a relative component of most roles in today's services heavy economy. I then showed a data-driven analysis of the relative measure of knowledge work per industry sector so the reader can better understand their own market segment.


            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              I go on to quantify that Non-knowledge work economic roles are focused on producing labor as their value creation output; <b>Knowledge work economic roles are focused on producing information as their output</b> (information to be used in labor, or information to coordinate with other workers).

            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              <b>I want to reduce this idea to simply "knowledge work is information transformation".</b>

            </p>


            <p class="fs-lg">

            In the last article I wrote about how services sectors process information to give their organization an advantage over other competitors that do not use technology as effectively as they do. This idea of organizational information transformation maps directly to our definition of knowledge work. Knowledge work is what is driving information processing in these organizations. Further, if technology can accelerate information processing tasks, they can also be considered knowledge work accelerators. 

            </p>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              The idea of knowledge work acceleration has not been without its critcisms, however.

            </p>


            <p class="fs-lg">

              Much ink has been spilled over the potential destruction of jobs in our economy because of technology and artifcial intelligence. If you think back to how structural transformation disrupted previouos epochs of economic activity and role distributions, you'll notice:

            </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Agriculture: physical labor was disrupted and re-allocated</li>
                <li>Manufacturing: physical labor was disrupted and re-allocated</li>
                

              </ul>

            <p class="fs-lg">

              However, physical labor is not the output of knowledge work, and so when technoogies such as large language models begin to disrupt information processing roles, this starts to disrupt a class of worker that previously felt insulated from the effects of structural transformation. This "white-collar"-class of worker is not used to feeling this existential pressure, and so that's where some of the anxiety is coming from.

            </p>


            <p class="fs-lg">


              In the next article I further expand on the idea of "knowledge work as information transformation", and how we can model that inside an organization.
