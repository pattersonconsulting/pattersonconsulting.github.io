            <h1 id="a-definition-for-data-engineering">A Definition for
            Data Engineering</h1>
            <p><strong>Data engineering is the discipline focused on
            designing, constructing, and maintaining the systems that
            manage the reliable and efficient processing of large
            volumes of data. This encompasses tasks such as collecting,
            storing, transforming, and organizing data to make it
            accessible and usable for analysis, reporting, and
            decision-making.</strong></p>
            <p>By working with various tools and technologies, data
            engineers build robust data pipelines, ensure data quality,
            and support the needs of data scientists, analysts, and
            other stakeholders within an organization. Essentially, data
            engineering provides the crucial infrastructure for
            data-driven insights and strategic decisions.</p>
            <p>A data engineer’s role is multifaceted, reflecting the
            diverse needs of an organization. They are responsible for
            storing, extracting, transforming, loading, aggregating, and
            validating data. This involves building efficient data
            pipelines, ensuring data adheres to governance rules, and
            understanding the best storage and query options based on
            the data’s structure. For instance, an enterprise might use
            AWS for cloud services, requiring different strategies for
            handling structured, unstructured, normalized, or
            denormalized data, as well as row or columnar data formats.
            Key considerations include the nature of the data (e.g.,
            key/value-based) and the complexity of relationships within
            the data, influencing how it is ingested, processed, and
            curated.</p>
            <p>For application developers, data engineering focuses on
            moving data in bulk rather than transaction by transaction,
            addressing a common pain point in many organizations. For
            upper management, it can be likened to constructing a solid
            foundation necessary for all data-related projects and
            initiatives. The versatility of a data engineer, much like a
            Swiss army knife, allows them to adapt to various roles and
            responsibilities, ensuring that systems have reliable,
            timely, and well-controlled data. Their work enables the
            organization to derive meaningful insights and solve complex
            problems, making data engineering a strategic initiative for
            any data-driven enterprise.</p>
            <p>Before we get into the 3 phases of data engineering and
            then further in this article the evolution of data
            engineering, I want to talk for a minute about where great
            data products and ideas come from with respect to the data
            engineering proces. I want to talk about the ideas
            introduced in “The Lab and the Factory”.</p>
            <h2 id="the-lab-and-the-factory">The Lab and the
            Factory</h2>
            <p>In the context of data engineering, the concepts of “<a
            href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/two-departments-for-data-succe">The
            Lab and The Factory</a>” (from the original article “To Work
            with Data, You Need a Lab and a Factory” by Thomas C. Redman
            and Bill Sweeney in Harvard Business Review, 2013)
            illustrate two distinct yet interconnected phases of data
            handling and processing.</p>
            <p>The “Lab” represents the experimental phase where data
            scientists and analysts explore data, develop hypotheses,
            and create new ideas, machine learning models, or new data
            products. This environment is characterized by agility,
            flexibility, and spartan use of resources. This allows for
            rapid iteration and the testing of various approaches and
            ideas. Many new and emerge data products come from the lab,
            where engineers test out an idea in a Jupyter notebook or a
            python script with a data sample. However, many times the
            engineer needs to quickly throw together some tools or code,
            and its often a jumbled mess — which is ok because many of
            the ideas will fail.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the “Factory” refers to the production
            phase where data workflows and models developed in the “Lab”
            are operationalized and scaled for regular use. This
            involves automating data pipelines, ensuring data quality,
            and optimizing performance to handle large volumes of data
            efficiently. In the “Factory”, data engineering emphasizes
            stability, scalability, and reliability, ensuring that the
            insights and models produced in the “Lab” can be
            consistently applied in real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p>By bridging these two phases, data engineering enables
            organizations to transition seamlessly from experimentation
            to deployment, driving sustained value from their data
            assets. However, this is not always easy because when we
            want to move one of those precious few good ideas that make
            it out of the “Lab”, the code or notebook is not ready to be
            a full productionized data pipeline or process. This is
            where a good data engineering practice and team shine. Let’s
            dig into what the 3 phases of the productionized data
            engineering process look like.</p>
            <h2 id="the-3-key-phases-of-data-engineering">The 3 Key
            Phases of Data Engineering</h2>
            <p>Data engineering involves three crucial phases:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>data collection</li>
            <li>data transformation</li>
            <li>data analysis and integration</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/pct_3_stages_data_eng_2024.png"
            alt="The 3 Stages of Data Engineering" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">The 3 Stages of Data
            Engineering</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The first phase, data collection, focuses on gathering
            data from diverse internal and external sources, which can
            be ingested in real-time or in batch processes. Ensuring
            this data is cataloged properly is essential for maintaining
            security, governance, and compliance. Additionally,
            monitoring the quality and performance of the collected data
            is vital to prevent issues downstream and to maintain the
            integrity of the datasets.</p>
            <p>The second phase, data transformation, involves cleansing
            and enriching the data to enhance its value and usability.
            This phase includes modeling the data to suit the specific
            needs of various stakeholders, making it more accessible and
            relevant. Effective management of workflows for scheduling,
            auditing, and performance is critical during this phase to
            ensure smooth and efficient operations.</p>
            <p>The final phase, data analysis and integration, leverages
            tools for analytics, machine learning, and AI to extract
            insights from the data. This phase also focuses on serving
            data to applications, processes, or people, and governing
            the catalog of data, dictionaries, and mappings to maintain
            an organized and accessible data environment. In more recent
            times this involves integrating data into systems that
            support generative AI as well.</p>
            <p>Together, these phases enable a seamless flow from raw
            data to actionable insights, driving informed
            decision-making and innovation.</p>
            <h1 id="why-is-data-engineering-important">Why is Data
            Engineering Important?</h1>
            <p>Data engineering serves as the backbone of any
            data-driven operation, facilitating the collection, storage,
            processing, and analysis of vast quantities of information.
            Here are three key reasons why data engineering holds
            paramount importance:</p>
            <ol type="1">

            </ol>
            <p>Data engineers play a crucial role in efficiently
            collecting data from various sources, storing it in data
            lakes or Kafka topics, and determining optimal ways to join
            these datasets. They ensure data pipelines have accurate
            inputs and outputs, often involving reconciliation and
            validation processes. By utilizing monitoring tools and SRE
            practices, they maintain continuous data flow and keep
            information current.</p>
            <p><strong>Ultimately, data engineers add significant value
            by automating and optimizing complex systems, transforming
            raw data into accessible and actionable business
            assets.</strong></p>

            engineering by efficiently aggregating data from diverse
            sources like ERP systems, supply chains, and third-party
            vendors into centralized data lakes, cloud data warehouses,
            or semantic layers.</strong></p>
            <p>Data engineers optimize the joining of these datasets and
            build robust pipelines that ensure seamless data flow and
            availability for business intelligence tools. They maintain
            data accuracy through reconciliation and validation, and use
            monitoring tools and SRE practices to keep data pipelines
            up-to-date. Ultimately, data engineers transform complex
            data systems into accessible, valuable business assets
            through automation and optimization.</p>
            <p>Data engineering supports business teams, product owners,
            and data science teams by providing a reliable
            infrastructure for data management. It ensures data is
            aggregated, validated, and stored centrally, allowing
            business teams to quickly access accurate information for
            decision-making. Product owners benefit from up-to-date and
            accessible data for tracking metrics and improving products.
            Data scientists rely on the robust data pipelines maintained
            by data engineers, freeing them to focus on analysis and
            model building. Overall, data engineering transforms complex
            data systems into valuable, actionable assets for these key
            stakeholders.</p>
            <h2 id="data-engineering-and-generative-ai">Data Engineering
            and Generative AI</h2>

            Airflow, Apache Oozie, and AWS Glue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These technologies work together to enable data engineers
            to efficiently collect, process, store, analyze, and
            visualize large volumes of data, ultimately supporting
            data-driven decision-making and innovation within
            organizations.</p>
            <p>Key data transformation technologies in data engineering
            enable the processing, manipulation, and enrichment of data
            to prepare it for analysis, reporting, or other downstream
            tasks. These technologies help transform raw data into a
            format that is suitable for consumption by users or

            operations. They play a crucial role in enabling efficient
            data engineering practices and supporting the development of
            data-driven applications and analytics solutions.</p>
            <h2
            id="why-are-cloud-platforms-popular-for-data-engineering">Why
            Are Cloud Platforms Popular for Data Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Cloud platforms are popular for data engineering due to
            their scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. They
            allow data engineers to easily scale resources up or down
            based on demand, handle large data volumes, and experiment
            with various configurations without upfront hardware
            investments. The pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures cost
            efficiency by charging only for the resources used,
            eliminating the need for significant capital
            expenditures.</p>
            <p>Additionally, cloud platforms offer managed services that
            simplify infrastructure management, allowing data engineers
            to focus on optimizing data pipelines. Their global reach
            reduces latency for distributed applications, and robust
            security features ensure data protection and regulatory
            compliance. Seamless integration with other services and
            continuous innovation provide data engineers with the latest
            tools and technologies, making cloud platforms a versatile
            and forward-thinking choice for data engineering across
            diverse industries.</p>
            <p>However, data engineering did not start in the cloud. I
            believe to understand data engineering you need to be aware
            of the evolution of data engineering.</p>
            <h2 id="the-evolution-of-data-engineering">The Evolution of
            Data Engineering</h2>
            <p>To better understand the role of data engineering and the
            types of engineers involved, I want to take a quick look at
            how the space has evolved over the past 20 years. In that
            timespan there have been 4 major eras:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>pre-2010: “Traditional RDBMS”, Stored Procedures, SQL,
            Informatica, etc</li>
            <li>2010-2015: “Big data era”, hadoop, MapReduce, Oozie</li>
            <li>2016-2020: “Migration to the cloud”, data pipelines on
            cloud platforms, rise of python, re-birth of SQL</li>
            <li>2021-2024: “The Semantic Era”, DBT, semantic layer,
            supporting Gen AI</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="pre-2010-traditional-rdbms">pre-2010: Traditional
            RDBMS</h3>
            <p>In this era tools such traditional RDBMS systems (Oracle,
            MySQL, SQL Server, etc) and distributed database systems
            (e.g., Teradata, Vertica) worked with tooling such as
            Informatica to build early data pipelines. SQL was the
            dominant data transformation language.</p>
            <h3 id="big-data">2010-2015: Big Data</h3>
            <p>This era was defined by the growth of “big data”, Hadoop,
            distributed systems, and computation at scale. In the “big
            data”-era, data engineering was more commonly referred to as
            ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and there was a movement away
            from SQL towards other methods such as MapReduce (note:
            projects such as Apache Hive still allowed a SQL-variant to
            run on MapReduce). Apache Oozie was the go-to workflow
            orchestrator during the Hadoop era. Data pipelines for
            machine learning use cases began to emerge at the tail end
            of this era.</p>
            <h3 id="migration-to-the-cloud">2016-2020: Migration to the
            Cloud</h3>
            <p>Cloud costs came down, python continued to rise in
            prominence in the data space, and SQL finds a re-birth with
            the introduction of cloud platform data warehouses.
            Companies began to test out moving some of their data
            pipelines to the cloud.</p>
            <p>Machine learning and data science comes to prominence
            with the rise of deep learning, GPUs, and the python
            ecosystem. In this era feature engineering becomes a
            practice that dovetails into the outputs of data engineering
            for machine learning projects.</p>
            <p>Maxime Beauchemin wrote a key article on the role of the
            data engineering in 2017 called “<a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-rise-of-the-data-engineer-91be18f1e603/">The
            Rise of the Data Engineer</a>” where he defines Data
            Engineering as:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>“data engineers build tools, infrastructure, frameworks,
            and services. In fact, it’s arguable that data engineering
            is much closer to software engineering than it is to a data
            science”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It was also in this era that DBT emerges as an
            orchestration tool built on SQL, rising with the new wave of
            cloud data warehouses. Further, there is a shift from ETL
            towards ELT that reflects a broader evolution in data
            engineering practices, driven by the need for more efficient
            and scalable data processing solutions.</p>
            <h3 id="the-semantic-era">2021-2024: The Semantic Era</h3>
            <p>In our current era we continue to see companies build out
            their data platforms and data products on the cloud in the
            generative AI age. New trends we see are “data modeling in
            the semantic layer” (e.g., <a
            href="http://www.cube.dev/">cube.dev’s semantic layer</a>)
            to abstract certain logic out of the BI-layer such that
            other tools can use a unified data model.</p>
            <p>This centralized data model is also useful in the
            generative AI era where we can allow agents to use business
            logic over data models specific to the organization. There
            is also associated semantic metadata that is useful for
            reasoning in large language models (e.g., “generative AI”).
            These new Gen AI use cases <a
            href="https://pattersonconsultingtn.com/blog/evolution_of_retrieval_augmented_generation_jan_2024.html">need
            data and metadata in a way that is different from
            traditional data science and machine learning</a>. This
            information is closer in structure to traditional data
            warehouse data models yet have their own specific data
            structures and query methods to power semantic Gen AI
            applications. This new area of data engineering is why I
            call this era “The Semantic Era” of data engineering.</p>
            <p>Now that we understand what data engineering is and how
            it has evolved, let’s take a look at how data teams are
            structured.</p>
            <h1 id="data-engineers-in-data-teams">Data Engineers in Data
            Teams</h1>
            <p>There are different roles on modern data teams in larger
            organizations. These roles are commonly:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>data engineer</li>
            <li>analytics engineer</li>
            <li>data analyst</li>

            does in 2024.</p>
            <h2 id="data-engineer">Data Engineer</h2>
            <p>A data engineer is like the backbone of a thriving
            ecosystem, ensuring every component works harmoniously to
            sustain the whole. Data engineers primarily focus on
            designing, building, and maintaining data infrastructure and
            pipelines to support data-driven applications and analytics.
            Their responsibilities include data ingestion,
            transformation, storage, and retrieval. They also ensure
            data quality, reliability, and availability.</p>
            <p>Data engineers typically possess skills in programming
            languages like Python, SQL, and Scala. They are proficient
            in working with big data technologies such as Apache Spark,
            Hadoop, and Kafka. They also have expertise in data
            modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and
            database management.</p>
            <p>Their main objective is to enable efficient data
            processing, analysis, and visualization, ultimately

            <h3 id="what-tasks-are-handled-by-data-engineers">What Tasks
            are Handled by Data Engineers?</h3>
            <p>In smaller companies, data engineering roles often extend
            to encompass platform engineering (DevOps) responsibilities,
            managing the organization’s data infrastructure. This
            includes setting up and maintaining platforms like Hadoop,

            for data collection, storage, and processing. They implement
            data governance practices to ensure data quality and
            accuracy, and they perform large-scale transformations to
            prepare data for analysis. Data scientists, on the other
            hand, use this well-prepared data to create models and
            extract insights. They conduct complex analyses and develop
            algorithms, often requiring sophisticated mathematical and
            statistical techniques that go beyond the typical scope of a
            data engineer’s work. In scenarios where these models need
            to be productionized, machine learning engineers bridge the
            gap, turning prototypes into scalable solutions. This
            division of labor ensures that each expert can leverage
            their specialized skills to contribute to the overall

            enterprise data into natural language interfaces</a>,
            scenario analyses, and workflow automations.</p>
            <p>Generative AI Engineer == Data Enginer + Prompt
            Engineer</p>
            <p>Make no mistake, “Generative AI Engineer” is that next
            hot job title.</p>
            <h2 id="platform-engineer">Platform Engineer</h2>
            <p>Platform Engineers (e.g., “cloud dev ops”) focus on
