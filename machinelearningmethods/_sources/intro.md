# Introduction

Welcome to our online resource "Notes on Machine Learning Methods"

My name is Josh Patterson and I am the CEO of Patterson Consulting and Co-Author of both "Deep Learning: A Practitioner's Approach" (O'Reilly, 2018) and "Kubeflow Operations Guide" (O'Reilly, 2021).

This is a place where I write short machine learning-related tutorials that support our blog articles. The goal of this online publication is to share practical methods as they evolve in the practice of machine learning and data science.
